# Revision on vectors

The quantities which we deal with in our life are divided into two kinds of quantities:

**(1) Scalar quantities:**  
They are the quantities which are completely determined if we knew their magnitude only as a real number.  
As: length, mass, time, temperature degree, volume, distance.

**(2) Vector quantity:**  
It is a quantity determined by a real number (the magnitude of this quantity) besides the direction.  
_i.e._ The vector quantity is determined completely if we knew its magnitude and its direction.

* **Directed line segment:**  
  It is a straight line segment having an initial point and an ending point, with direction defined from the initial point to the ending point.

* **The norm of the directed line segment** \(\overrightarrow{AB}\):  
  The norm of \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) is the length of \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) and it is denoted by \(\|\overrightarrow{AB}\|\).

* The two directed line segments are equivalent if they have:  
  - The same length (the norm) and the same direction.

* \(\overrightarrow{AB} \neq \overrightarrow{BA}\) (they have opposite directions)

* \(\overrightarrow{AB} = - \overrightarrow{BA}\)

* \(\|\overrightarrow{AB}\| = \|\overrightarrow{BA}\|\)


---


* The position vector of a given point (A) with respect to the origin point (O) is the directed line segment \(\overrightarrow{OA}\), it is denoted by \(\vec{A}\).

### For example:

#### In the opposite figure:

If \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) is the position vector of the point (A) = \((x, y)\) then:

* \(\|\vec{A}\| =\) the length of \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\)

* If \(\|\vec{A}\| = 1\) length unit (unity), then \(\vec{A}\) is called the **unit vector**.

* \(\vec{i} = (1, 0)\), \(\vec{j} = (0, 1)\) are two unit vectors (called two basic unit vectors) in the two directions of the two coordinate axes.

* \(\vec{O} = (0, 0)\) it is the zero vector which has no direction and it is denoted by \(\vec{O}\).

* \(\vec{A} = (x, y)\) is called the **Cartesian form** of the vector \(\vec{A}\).

* \(\vec{A} = x \vec{i} + y \vec{j}\) expresses the vector \(\vec{A}\) in terms of the two basic unit vectors.

* \(\vec{A} = \left(\|\vec{A}\|, \theta \right)\) is called the **polar form** of the vector \(\vec{A}\).

* \(\theta\) is the measure of the angle made by the vector \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) with the positive direction of the x-axis; it is called the **polar angle**.

* \(x = \|\vec{A}\| \cos \theta\), then \(\cos \theta = \frac{x}{\|\vec{A}\|}\)

* \(y = \|\vec{A}\| \sin \theta\), then \(\sin \theta = \frac{y}{\|\vec{A}\|}\)

* If \(\vec{A} = (x_1, y_1)\), \(\vec{B} = (x_2, y_2)\), then:

  - \(\vec{A} = \vec{B}\) if and only if \(x_1 = x_2\), \(y_1 = y_2\)

  - \(\vec{A} \pm \vec{B} = (x_1 \pm x_2, y_1 \pm y_2)\)

  - \(\overrightarrow{AB} = \vec{B} - \vec{A} = (x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1)\)

  - \(k \vec{A} = k (x, y) = (k x, k y)\)

* \(\vec{A} \parallel k \vec{A}\) with regard that:

| If       | Condition | Then                                                                 | Note          |
|----------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| \(k > 0\) | then      | \(\vec{A}\) and \(k \vec{A}\) have the **same direction**            | where \(k \neq 0\) |
| \(k < 0\) | then      | \(\vec{A}\) and \(k \vec{A}\) have **opposite direction**            |               |

$$\overrightarrow{AB} + \overrightarrow{AC} = 2 \overrightarrow{AD}$$  
$$\overrightarrow{BD} + \overrightarrow{CD} = \overrightarrow{0}$$  

$$\overrightarrow{AB} - \overrightarrow{AC} = \overrightarrow{CB}$$

# Physical applications:

## The resultant force \(\vec{R}\)

* The resultant of a set of forces acting on a body is operated as the operation of adding vectors.

$$\vec{R} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 + \vec{F}_3 + \ldots$$

### For example:

If we define a unit vector \(\hat{e}\) in the direction of the motion of the body then:

----

### In the case of motion of the body on a rough plane

| The friction force | The pushing force \(\vec{F}\) |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| 3 newton          | 5 newton                      |

The resultant force:

$$\vec{R} = 5 \hat{e} + (-3 \hat{e}) = 2 \hat{e}$$

*i.e.* The magnitude of the resultant = 2 newton

* The direction of the resultant is in the direction of the motion of the body.

----

### In the case of vertical motion

| Forces | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Resultant force | \(50 \hat{e} + (-30 \hat{e}) = 20 \hat{e}\) |
| Magnitude of the resultant | 20 Kg.wt. |

* The direction of resultant is in the direction of the weight.

* The gravitational force (the weight) is shown acting downward.

* The resistance force \(r = 3 \text{ kg.wt.}\)

* Weight \(w = 50 \text{ kg.wt.}\)

----

* If the two forces have the same magnitude and the same line of action but in two opposite directions then the resultant \(\vec{R} = \vec{0}\).

* If the resultant of a set of concurrent forces = \(\vec{0}\), this means the set of forces are in equilibrium.

# Example 1

1. Write the vector \(\vec{A} = \left(3, -\sqrt{3}\right)\) in the polar form.

2. Write in terms of the two basic unit vectors the vector \(\vec{A}\) whose norm = 10 length unit and act in the direction of Western North.

### Solution

1. 
\[
\|\vec{A}\| = \sqrt{9 + 3} = 2\sqrt{3}
\]

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{x}{\|\vec{A}\|} = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} > 0
\]

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{y}{\|\vec{A}\|} = \frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{1}{2} < 0
\]

\(\therefore \theta\) lies in the 4th quadrant

\[
\therefore \theta = 360^\circ - 30^\circ = 330^\circ
\]

\[
\therefore \vec{A} = \left(2\sqrt{3}, 330^\circ\right)
\]

2. 
\[
\|\vec{A}\| = 10, \quad \theta = 135^\circ
\]

\[
x = \|\vec{A}\| \cos \theta = 10 \cos 135^\circ = -5 \sqrt{2}
\]

\[
y = \|\vec{A}\| \sin \theta = 10 \sin 135^\circ = 5 \sqrt{2}
\]

\[
\therefore \vec{A} = \left(-5 \sqrt{2}, 5 \sqrt{2}\right)
\]

\[
\therefore \vec{A} = -5 \sqrt{2} \, \mathbf{i} + 5 \sqrt{2} \, \mathbf{j}
\]

# Example 2

If the forces \(\vec{F}_1 = 2 \mathbf{i} + 3 \mathbf{j}\), \(\vec{F}_2 = a \mathbf{i} + \mathbf{j}\), \(\vec{F}_3 = 5 \mathbf{i} + b \mathbf{j}\) act on a particle,

Find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) if these forces:

1. Their resultant = \(5 \mathbf{i} - 2 \mathbf{j}\)

2. Are in equilibrium.

### Solution

The resultant is

\[
\vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 + \vec{F}_3 = (2 \mathbf{i} + 3 \mathbf{j}) + (a \mathbf{i} + \mathbf{j}) + (5 \mathbf{i} + b \mathbf{j}) = (2 + a + 5) \mathbf{i} + (3 + 1 + b) \mathbf{j}
\]

1. For the resultant \(5 \mathbf{i} - 2 \mathbf{j}\):

\[
(7 + a) \mathbf{i} + (4 + b) \mathbf{j} = 5 \mathbf{i} - 2 \mathbf{j}
\]

\[
7 + a = 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a = -2
\]

\[
4 + b = -2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = -6
\]

2. For the forces to be in equilibrium:

\[
\vec{R} = \vec{0}
\]

\[
(7 + a) \mathbf{i} + (4 + b) \mathbf{j} = \vec{0}
\]

\[
a = -7, \quad b = -4
\]

# Lesson 1

## Forces - Resultant of two forces meeting at a point

### The force

> "The force is defined as the effect of a natural body upon another one" by pushing, attraction, pressure or repulsion.

The natural body is a body consisting of material (mass) and volume not equal to zero.  
The natural bodies can be classified into two kinds:

* **Rigid bodies (solid bodies):** They are the bodies whose shapes do not change whatever the forces which are acting on them as solid metals, rocks, .......... .
* **Deformable bodies:** They are the bodies whose shapes can be disfigured as strings, liquids, gases, rubber and clay and our study in this unit will be continued to rigid bodies only.

### Kinds of forces

There are different kinds of forces, as:

1. **Tension force (T):**  
   As the force in the string (or the rope) when carrying a body at it.

(Tension in the string)


---


# Lesson One

## 2) Pressure force (P):

As the force that appears when a body stabilized on a surface.

## 3) Reaction force (r):

As the reaction of a smooth surface on a body stabilized on it.

## 4) Attraction forces and repulsion forces:

As the forces which formed between magnetic poles, electric charges and astronomical objects.

## 5) Gravitational forces (weights):

If we let a body in the air, then it will drop down towards the Earth because the attraction force of the Earth attracts any body towards it.  
This force is called gravitational force or weights.  
* Notice that: the weight (W) = the body mass × acceleration of gravity = m × g

----

## Expressing force

The force is a vector quantity so it can be represented by the same way as the vectors.

**i.e. The force can be expressed as follow:**

1. \(\vec{F} = (X, y)\) ⇒ the cartesian form.
2. \(\vec{F} = X \hat{i} + y \hat{j}\) ⇒ in terms of the fundamental unit vectors.
3. \(\vec{F} = (\|\vec{F}\|, \theta)\) ⇒ the polar form.

## Determination of the force

The force is a vector which passes through a fixed point.  
*i.e.* It acts in a given straight line.

**i.e. The force is determined by:**

1. The magnitude of the force.
2. The direction of the force.
3. The point of action of the force.

----

### For example:

The football player kicks the ball by a determined force (magnitude of the force) in a determined direction (direction of the force) in a certain point on the surface of the ball (Point of action of the force).

# UNIT 1

## The magnitude of the force

### 1) The measurement units:

* The magnitude of the force (The numerical value of the force) is measured by units which are called weight units.  
  As: gram weight (gm.wt.), kilogram weight (kg.wt.)  
  where  
  $$1 \text{ kg.wt.} = 1000 \text{ gm.wt.} = 10^3 \text{ gm.wt.}$$

* There are other units to measure the magnitude of force (they are called absolute units)  
  As: The dyne, the newton:  
  where  
  $$1 \text{ newton} = 100\,000 \text{ dyne} = 10^5 \text{ dyne}$$

* The weight units connect with the absolute units by the relation:  
  $$1 \text{ kg.wt.} = 9.8 \text{ newton}, \quad 1 \text{ gm.wt.} = 980 \text{ dyne}$$  
  (unless something else mentioned)

### 2) The direction of the force:

It is the direction of the vector which represents this force and it is determined by the measure of the polar angle of the force vector in the case of the coplanar forces in the same plane.  
* The polar angle is the positive directed angle which the vector makes with the positive direction of X-axis.

### 3) The point of action of the force:

The action of the force is determined by its point of action. If you try to open the door of a room or close it with a force near the line of hinges, you will find it difficult to rotate it.  
As you are far from the line of hinges, the difficulty becomes less. As shown in the figure.

## The line of action of the force

The line of action of the force is the line passing through the point of action parallel to the direction of the force.

**For example:**  
- The tension line in a string is the string itself.  
- The line of action of the weight of a body is the vertical line passing through the center of gravity of the body.

----

[The image on the right shows a door with force vectors labeled F applied at different points, illustrating difficulty in rotation near hinges. Below it is a diagram showing tension line, center of gravity of the body, weight's line, and weight acting vertically downward.]


---


# Lesson One

## Displacing (or translation) of the point of action of the force (force penetration)

If the force **F** acts on a rigid body and A is the point of its action, then we can displace this point to another point on the body "B" or "C" or .... on the line of action of the force without changing in its influence on the body.

*i.e.* Any point lying on the line of action of a force can be considered as a point of action of this force.

----

## Resultant of two forces meeting at a point

The resultant of two or more forces is a single force that has the same effect as the two or more forces.

----

## Finding the resultant of two forces meeting at a point (geometrically)

**This method depends on the parallelogram rule to add two forces:**

If two forces (**F₁**, **F₂**) meeting at a point are represented in magnitude and direction by two sides of a parallelogram meeting at this point, then their resultant (**R**) is represented in magnitude and direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram which starts from the same point.

$$
\vec{R} = \vec{F_1} + \vec{F_2}
$$

----

### Example 1

**F₁ and F₂ are two forces acting on the point O from a solid body, where F₁ = 500 newton and acts on the direction of East, F₂ = 300 newton and acts in the direction 60° North of West, find their resultant graphically.**

### Solution

* We use the drawing scale one cm per 100 newton.

* Draw **OA** to represent **F₁** and **OB** to represent **F₂**, where  
  $$\|OA\| = 5 \text{ cm}, \quad \|OB\| = 3 \text{ cm}.$$

* Then complete the parallelogram OACB, then **OC** represents the resultant **R**.

----

### Diagrams description:

- A parallelogram diagram with points A, B, C, D, showing vectors **F₁** along AB, **F₂** along AD, and resultant **R** along AC.
- A force diagram showing points A, B, C on a line with force **F** acting.
- A force system with a spring and forces labeled C, B, A, and F.
- A coordinate system with directions North, South, East, West, showing vectors **F₁** along East, **F₂** at 60° North of West, and resultant **R**.



---


# Unit 1

* By measuring, we find that \( \| \overrightarrow{OC} \| = 4.4 \, \text{cm} \) approximately, \( m(\angle AOC) = 37^\circ \)  
\(\therefore \overrightarrow{R}\) acts at O and its magnitude = 440 newton in the direction 37° North of east approximately.

----

### Remark

If \(\overrightarrow{F_1}\) and \(\overrightarrow{F_2}\) act at the point O and if they are represented by the two vectors \(\overrightarrow{AO}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) as in the opposite figure, then according to the rule of addition of two vectors, \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) represents the resultant of these two vectors. But the line of action of the resultant of \(\overrightarrow{F_1}\) and \(\overrightarrow{F_2}\) must pass through O.

Therefore, we draw from O the directed line segment \(\overrightarrow{OC}\) equivalent to \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) which represents the resultant of these two forces perfectly.

## Finding the resultant of two forces meeting at a point analytically

Let the two forces \(\overrightarrow{F_1}\) and \(\overrightarrow{F_2}\) meet at O and \(\alpha\) is the measure of the angle between the directions of the two forces.

If \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) represent the two forces \(\overrightarrow{F_1}\) and \(\overrightarrow{F_2}\), then \(\overrightarrow{OC}\) represents the resultant \(\overrightarrow{R}\).

Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle between the resultant \(\overrightarrow{R}\) and the force \(\overrightarrow{F_1}\), then from our study of the cosine law in trigonometry, we can get the resultant of the two forces \(\overrightarrow{F_1}\) and \(\overrightarrow{F_2}\) in magnitude and direction from the following relations:

$$
R = \sqrt{F_1^2 + F_2^2 + 2 F_1 F_2 \cos \alpha} \quad , \quad \tan \theta = \frac{F_2 \sin \alpha}{F_1 + F_2 \cos \alpha}
$$

where \(F_1\), \(F_2\), and \(R\) are the magnitudes of \(\overrightarrow{F_1}\), \(\overrightarrow{F_2}\), and \(\overrightarrow{R}\).

## Special cases

### 1) If the two forces are perpendicular (i.e. \(\alpha = 90^\circ\)):

\[
\cos \alpha = 0, \quad \sin \alpha = 1
\]

Substituting in the two previous relations, we get that:

$$
R = \sqrt{F_1^2 + F_2^2} \quad , \quad \tan \theta = \frac{F_2}{F_1}
$$

# Lesson One

## 2. If the two forces are equal in magnitude (i.e. \( F_1 = F_2 = F \)):

In this case, the parallelogram OACB exchanges to a rhombus, then:

$$
R = OC = 2 \, OM = 2 \, OA \cos \frac{\alpha}{2} = 2F \cos \frac{\alpha}{2}
$$

i.e.

$$
R = 2F \cos \frac{\alpha}{2}, \quad \theta = \frac{\alpha}{2} \quad \text{(where } \vec{R} \text{ bisects the angle between the two forces)}
$$

Notice that: \(\alpha = 120^\circ\), so \(R = F\).

----

## 3. If the two forces have the same line of action and the same direction \((i.e. \alpha = 0^\circ)\):

\[
\cos \alpha = 1
\]

Substituting:

$$
R = \sqrt{F_1^2 + F_2^2 + 2 F_1 F_2 \times 1} = \sqrt{(F_1 + F_2)^2} = F_1 + F_2
$$

i.e.

\[
R = F_1 + F_2
\]

and the direction of the resultant is the same direction of the line of action of the two forces.

*In this case, \(R\) is called the greatest or the maximum value of the resultant.*

----

## 4. If the two forces have the same line of action but in opposite directions \((i.e. \alpha = 180^\circ)\):

\[
\cos \alpha = -1
\]

Substituting:

$$
R = \sqrt{F_1^2 + F_2^2 + 2 F_1 F_2 \times (-1)} = \sqrt{F_1^2 + F_2^2 - 2 F_1 F_2} = \sqrt{(F_1 - F_2)^2} = |F_1 - F_2|
$$

i.e.

\[
R = |F_1 - F_2|
\]

and the direction of the resultant is the direction of the greater force in magnitude.

*In this case, \(R\) is called the smallest or the minimum value of the resultant.*

----

## 5. If the two forces are equal in magnitude and have the same line of action but in opposite directions:

In this case: \(F_1 = F_2 = F\), \(\alpha = 180^\circ\)

\[
\cos \alpha = -1
\]

\[
R = \sqrt{F^2 + F^2 - 2 F^2} = 0
\]

i.e. The resultant is zero vector.



---


# Unit 1

## 6) If the resultant is perpendicular to the first force (i.e. \(\theta = 90^\circ\)):

- \(\therefore \theta = 90^\circ\)
- \(\therefore R^2 = F_2^2 - F_1^2\) (Pythagoras' theorem)
- \(\cot \theta = 0\)
- \(\therefore \frac{F_1 + F_2 \cos \alpha}{F_2 \sin \alpha} = 0\)
- \(\therefore F_1 + F_2 \cos \alpha = 0\)
- \(\therefore \cos \alpha = -\frac{F_1}{F_2}\)
- \(\therefore \alpha\) is an obtuse angle, \(F_1 < F_2\)

> *i.e.* When the resultant is perpendicular to one of the two forces it is perpendicular to the smallest force.

## Example 2

Two forces of magnitudes 5 newton and 3 newton act at a point and include an angle of measure \(60^\circ\), find their resultant in magnitude and direction analytically.

### Solution

\[
\therefore R = \sqrt{F_1^2 + F_2^2 + 2 F_1 F_2 \cos \alpha}
\]

\[
\therefore R = \sqrt{25 + 9 + 2 \times 5 \times 3 \times \cos 60^\circ} = 7 \text{ newton}
\]

\[
\therefore \tan \theta = \frac{F_2 \sin \alpha}{F_1 + F_2 \cos \alpha}
\]

\[
\therefore \tan \theta = \frac{3 \sin 60^\circ}{5 + 3 \cos 60^\circ} = \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{13}
\]

\[
\therefore \theta \approx 21^\circ 47'
\]

\(\therefore\) The magnitude of \(\vec{R}\) is 7 newton and includes an angle of measure \(21^\circ 47'\) with the first force.

----

## Example 3

Two perpendicular forces act at a point such that \(F_1 = 6\) newton and \(F_2 = 2.5\) newton. Find their resultant in magnitude and find its direction.

### Solution

\[
\therefore R = \sqrt{F_1^2 + F_2^2}
\]

\[
\therefore R = \sqrt{(6)^2 + (2.5)^2} = 6.5 \text{ newton}
\]

\[
\therefore \tan \theta = \frac{F_2}{F_1} = \frac{2.5}{6} = \frac{5}{12}
\]

\[
\therefore \theta = 22^\circ 37'
\]

\(\therefore\) The magnitude of \(\vec{R}\) is 6.5 newton and includes an angle of measure \(22^\circ 37'\) with the first force.

# Lesson One

## Example 4

Two forces of magnitudes 50 newton and 100 newton act at a point. Their resultant is perpendicular to the first force. Find the measure of the angle included between the two forces and the magnitude of the resultant.

### Solution

- \( F_1 = 50 \) newton, \( F_2 = 100 \) newton.
- The resultant is perpendicular to the first force.
- \( F_1 + F_2 \cos \alpha = 0 \)  
  \( 50 + 100 \cos \alpha = 0 \)
- \( \cos \alpha = \frac{-50}{100} = -\frac{1}{2} \)  
  \( \therefore \alpha = 120^\circ \)

- Magnitude of resultant:  
  \[
  R = \sqrt{(F_1)^2 + (F_2)^2 + 2 (F_1)(F_2) \cos \alpha}
  \]
  \[
  R = \sqrt{(50)^2 + (100)^2 + 2 \times 50 \times 100 \cos 120^\circ} = 50 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}
  \]

### Another solution:

- Let \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) represent the force whose magnitude is 50 newton,  
  \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) represents the force whose magnitude is 100 newton.
- The resultant is perpendicular to the first force.
- \(\triangle OAC\) is right-angled triangle at \(O\).
- \[
  \cos A = \frac{OA}{AC} = \frac{50}{100} = \frac{1}{2}
  \]
- \[
  m(\angle A) = 60^\circ
  \]
- \[
  m(\angle AOB) = 120^\circ
  \]
  and it is the measure of the angle between the two forces.
- \[
  R^2 = (100)^2 - (50)^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad R = \sqrt{(100)^2 - (50)^2} = 50 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}
  \]

### Solution

- Let the great force = \(F_1\) and the small force = \(F_2\).
- \[
  F_1 + F_2 = 32 \quad (1)
  \]
- \[
  F_1 - F_2 = 12 \quad (2)
  \]
- From (1) and (2):  
  \[
  F_1 = 22 \text{ kg.wt.} \quad \text{and} \quad F_2 = 10 \text{ kg.wt.}
  \]
- If \(\alpha = 60^\circ\), then  
  \[
  R = \sqrt{(22)^2 + (10)^2 + 2 \times 22 \times 10 \cos 60^\circ} = 2 \sqrt{201} \text{ kg.wt.}
  \]

### Solution

- \[
R = 2F \cos \frac{\alpha}{2}
\]
- \[
70 \sqrt{3} = 2F \cos 30^\circ
\]
- \[
F = 70 \text{ newton}
\]
- The two forces are 70 newton and 70 newton.

Find the magnitude of their resultant if the line of action of the resultant inclines by an angle of measure 45° with the force \(F\).

### Solution

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{F_1 \sin \alpha}{F_2 + F_1 \cos \alpha}
\]

where \(\theta\) is the measure of the angle between the resultant and the force \(F\).

\[
\tan 45^\circ = \frac{6 \sin 135^\circ}{F + 6 \cos 135^\circ}
\]

\[
1 = \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{F - 3 \sqrt{2}}
\]

\[
F - 3 \sqrt{2} = 3 \sqrt{2}
\]

\[
F = 6 \sqrt{2} \text{ kg.wt.}
\]

\[
R = \sqrt{(F_1)^2 + (F_2)^2 + 2 F_1 F_2 \cos \alpha}
\]

\[
R = \sqrt{(6)^2 + (6 \sqrt{2})^2 + 2 \times 6 \times 6 \sqrt{2} \cos 135^\circ} = 6 \text{ kg.wt.}
\]

## Example 8

Two forces acting at a point. If their magnitudes are 4 \(F\) and 3 \(F\), find the measure of the angle between them if the magnitude of the resultant is \(\sqrt{13} F\).

### Solution

\[
R^2 = (F_1)^2 + (F_2)^2 + 2 (F_1)(F_2) \cos \alpha
\]

\[
(\sqrt{13} F)^2 = (4F)^2 + (3F)^2 + 2 \times 4F \times 3F \times \cos \alpha
\]

\[
13 F^2 = 16 F^2 + 9 F^2 + 24 F^2 \cos \alpha
\]

\[
-12 F^2 = 24 F^2 \cos \alpha
\]

\[
\cos \alpha = \frac{-12 F^2}{24 F^2} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

\[
\alpha = 120^\circ
\]

# Lesson One

## Example 9

If the magnitude of their resultant is \(7 \sqrt{3}\) kg.wt.  
Find the value of F and the measure of the angle which the resultant makes with the first force.

### Solution

\[
R^2 = F_1^2 + F_2^2 + 2 F_1 F_2 \cos \alpha
\]

\[
(7 \sqrt{3})^2 = 7^2 + F^2 + 2 \times 7 \times F \cos 120^\circ
\]

\[
147 = 49 + F^2 - 7F
\]

\[
F^2 - 7F - 98 = 0
\]

\[
(F - 14)(F + 7) = 0
\]

\[
F = 14 \text{ kg.wt.}
\]

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{F_2 \sin \alpha}{F_1 + F_2 \cos \alpha} = \frac{14 \sin 120^\circ}{7 + 14 \cos 120^\circ} = \frac{7 \sqrt{3}}{0} \quad \text{(undefined)}
\]

\[
\cot \theta = 0
\]

\[
\theta = 90^\circ
\]

i.e. The resultant is perpendicular to the first force.

----

## Example 10

Two forces of magnitudes 5 and \(5 \sqrt{2}\) kg.wt. act at a point.  
The first towards East, the second is towards Western North. Prove that the magnitude of the resultant = the magnitude of the first force and find the measure of the angle which the resultant makes with each of the two forces.

### Solution

\[
F_1 = 5 \text{ kg.wt.}, \quad F_2 = 5 \sqrt{2} \text{ kg.wt.}
\]

From the figure, \(\alpha = 135^\circ\)

\[
R = \sqrt{(F_1)^2 + (F_2)^2 + 2 F_1 F_2 \cos \alpha}
\]

\[
R = \sqrt{25 + 50 + 2 \times 5 \times 5 \sqrt{2} \times \cos 135^\circ}
\]

\[
R = 5 \text{ kg.wt.} = F_1
\]

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{F_2 \sin \alpha}{F_1 + F_2 \cos \alpha}
\]

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{5 \sqrt{2} \sin 135^\circ}{5 + 5 \sqrt{2} \cos 135^\circ} = \frac{5}{0} \quad \text{(undefined)}
\]

\[
\cot \theta = 0
\]

\[
\theta = 90^\circ
\]

\[
\vec{R} \text{ is perpendicular to } \vec{F_1}
\]

i.e. Towards North and makes an angle of measure \(135^\circ - 90^\circ = 45^\circ\) with \(\vec{F_2}\).

### Diagram Description

# Unit 1

## Example 11

Two equal forces intersect at a point and the magnitude of their resultant equals 8 newton, if one of them is reversed, then the magnitude of their resultant equals 6 newtons. Find the magnitude of each force.

### Solution

$$
R_1 = 2F \cos \frac{\alpha}{2} = 8
$$

$$
\therefore F \cos \frac{\alpha}{2} = 4 \quad (1)
$$

$$
R_2 = 2F \cos \left(\frac{180^\circ - \alpha}{2}\right) = 6
$$

$$
\therefore F \sin \frac{\alpha}{2} = 3 \quad (2)
$$

(First case)  
(Second case)

By squaring the two equations (1), (2) and adding:

$$
F^2 \cos^2 \frac{\alpha}{2} + F^2 \sin^2 \frac{\alpha}{2} = 16 + 9
$$

$$
\therefore F^2 = 25
$$

$$
\therefore F = 5 \text{ newton}
$$

The magnitude of each force is 5 newton.

----

### Notice that the two equations can be solved as the following:

Dividing equation (2) by equation (1):

$$
\tan \frac{\alpha}{2} = \frac{3}{4} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sin \frac{\alpha}{2} = \frac{3}{5}
$$

By substituting in equation (2):

$$
F \times \frac{3}{5} = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad F = 5 \text{ newton}
$$

The magnitude of each force is 5 newton.

----

### Another solution (Geometrically):

- The two forces are equal.
- \( R_1, R_2 \) bisect the angle between the two forces.
- \( R_1 \perp R_2 \)
- \( (R_1)^2 + (R_2)^2 = (2F)^2 \)
- \( 64 + 36 = 4F^2 \)
- \( F^2 = 25 \quad \Rightarrow \quad F = 5 \)

The magnitude of the two forces are 5, 5 newton.

----

### Diagrams description:

- First case: Two forces \( F \) at an angle \( \alpha \) with resultant \( R_1 \).
- Second case: One force reversed, angle \( 180^\circ - \alpha \), resultant \( R_2 \).
- Right triangle with sides 3, 4, 5 representing sine and cosine relations.
- Parallelogram showing vector addition with forces \( F \), \( R_1 = 8 \), \( R_2 = 6 \), and \( 2F \).

# Lesson 2

## Forces resolution into two components

### Resolution of a known force into two known directions

Suppose that the force \(\vec{R}\) acts at a point \(O\) and it is required to resolve \(\vec{R}\) into two components \(\vec{F_1}\) and \(\vec{F_2}\). Let \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) be the measure of angles of inclination of \(\vec{F_1}\) and \(\vec{F_2}\) to the direction of \(\vec{R}\).

Therefore, we draw using a drawing scale the vector \(\overrightarrow{OC}\) to represent the force \(\vec{R}\), then we draw from \(O\) the two rays \(\overrightarrow{OX}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OY}\) making two angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) with \(\overrightarrow{OC}\) and in different sides of it.

Then we draw from \(C\) two rays, one is parallel to \(\overrightarrow{OX}\) and the other is parallel to \(\overrightarrow{OY}\) to get the parallelogram \(OACB\) as in the shown figure, thus the vector \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) represents the component \(\vec{F_1}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) represents the component \(\vec{F_2}\) and the vector \(\overrightarrow{AC}\) represents \(\vec{F_2}\) also.

By using the sine rule on \(\triangle OAC\), where \(m(\angle ACO) = \theta_2\) and \(\sin(\angle OAC) = \sin[180^\circ - (\theta_1 + \theta_2)] = \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)\),

$$
\frac{F_1}{\sin \theta_2} = \frac{F_2}{\sin \theta_1} = \frac{R}{\sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}
$$

i.e.,

$$
F_1 \text{ (the magnitude of the component of } \vec{R}, \text{ which inclines by } \theta_1 \text{ on } \vec{R}) = \frac{R \sin \theta_2}{\sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}
$$

**And**

$$
F_2 \text{ (the magnitude of the component of } \vec{R}, \text{ which inclines by } \theta_2 \text{ on } \vec{R}) = \frac{R \sin \theta_1}{\sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}
$$

----

### Figure description:

- A parallelogram \(OACB\) is shown.
- Vector \(\vec{R}\) is represented by \(\overrightarrow{OC}\).
- Two rays \(\overrightarrow{OX}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OY}\) originate from \(O\), making angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) with \(\overrightarrow{OC}\).
- \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) represent the components \(\vec{F_1}\) and \(\vec{F_2}\).
- The angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) are marked between the vectors as described.

# UNIT 1

## Example 1

Resolve the force of magnitude 20 newton into two components, one of them inclined on the given force with an angle of measure 30° and the other force inclined by an angle of measure 45° on the other side of the force, then approximate the answer to the nearest one decimal.

### Solution

$$
F_1 = \frac{R \sin \theta_2}{\sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)} = \frac{20 \sin 45^\circ}{\sin 75^\circ} \simeq 14.6 \text{ newton}
$$

$$
F_2 = \frac{R \sin \theta_1}{\sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)} = \frac{20 \sin 30^\circ}{\sin 75^\circ} \simeq 10.4 \text{ newton}

## Example 2

In the opposite figure:

A light of weight 10 Newton is suspended by two strings \( \overline{AC} \), \( \overline{BC} \) fixed in two horizontal points with equal two angles, the measure of each of them is 20°.

1. Resolve the weight of the light in each of the two directions \( \overline{AC} \), \( \overline{BC} \).
2. What happens if the magnitude of the components of the weight in the two directions of the strings, if its angle decreased with horizontal less than 20°, and what do you deduce to the magnitude of the component of the weight, when the string becomes horizontal.

### Solution

1. The weight (10 newton) acts vertically downwards, and from the figure:

$$
\frac{W_1}{\sin 70^\circ} = \frac{W_2}{\sin 70^\circ} = \frac{10}{\sin 140^\circ}
$$

Therefore,

$$
W_1 = W_2 = \frac{10 \sin 70^\circ}{\sin 140^\circ} \simeq 15 \text{ newton}
$$

2. If the measure of the angle decreased with horizontal less than 20°, then the magnitude of the component will increase to become unlimited when the strings are horizontal.

## Resolution of the force into two perpendicular directions

Let the force \( \vec{R} \) act at the point O and we want to resolve this force into two perpendicular forces \( \vec{F_1} \) and \( \vec{F_2} \) such that \( \vec{F_1} \) inclines by \( \theta \) on the direction of \( \vec{R} \).

In this case, the parallelogram becomes a rectangle.

Applying the sine rule on \( \triangle OAC \) we get:

---


# Lesson Two

$$
\frac{F_1}{\sin(90^\circ - \theta)} = \frac{F_2}{\sin \theta} = \frac{R}{\sin 90^\circ}
$$

$$
\frac{F_1}{\cos \theta} = \frac{F_2}{\sin \theta} = \frac{R}{1} = R
$$

Thus,  
$$F_1 = R \cos \theta \quad , \quad F_2 = R \sin \theta$$

> **Note:**  
> \(F_1\) (the magnitude of the component in the given direction) = \(R \cos \theta\), and \(F_2\) (the magnitude of the component in the perpendicular direction to the given direction) = \(R \sin \theta\)

The component \(\overrightarrow{F_1}\) sometimes is called the projection of \(\overrightarrow{R}\) in the direction of \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and the component \(\overrightarrow{F_2}\) is called the projection of \(\overrightarrow{R}\) in the direction of \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

----

## Remarks

1. The magnitude of the component adjacent to the given angle = **R cos (this angle)**,  
   the magnitude of the other perpendicular component to the previous component = **R sin (this angle)**

### In the opposite figure:

If the component \(\overrightarrow{F_2}\) inclines on the direction of \(\overrightarrow{R}\) by an angle of measure \(\theta\), then

$$
F_2 = R \cos \theta \quad , \quad F_1 = R \sin \theta
$$

----

2. The component of \(\overrightarrow{R}\) in the same direction of \(\overrightarrow{R}\) = The same force \(\overrightarrow{R}\) and its component in the perpendicular direction to its direction = \(\overrightarrow{0}\).

Because in this case, the measure of the angle between \(\overrightarrow{R}\) and the first component = zero, then the magnitude of the first component =  
$$
R \cos 0^\circ = R \times 1 = R
$$  
and the magnitude of the perpendicular component on the previous component =  
$$
R \sin 0^\circ = R \times 0 = 0
$$

----

3. If \(\overrightarrow{i}\) and \(\overrightarrow{j}\) are two perpendicular unit vectors in the directions \(\overrightarrow{OX}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OY}\) where \(O\) is the origin point.

Then  
$$
\overrightarrow{F_1} = (R \cos \theta) \overrightarrow{i} \quad , \quad \overrightarrow{F_2} = (R \sin \theta) \overrightarrow{j}
$$

Therefore,  
$$
\overrightarrow{R} = \overrightarrow{F_1} + \overrightarrow{F_2} = (R \cos \theta) \overrightarrow{i} + (R \sin \theta) \overrightarrow{j}
$$

----

### Figures described:

- Third figure: Vector \(\overrightarrow{R}\) decomposed into components along perpendicular unit vectors \(\overrightarrow{i}\) and \(\overrightarrow{j}\) in directions \(OX\) and \(OY\).

# Unit 1

(4) If \(\vec{F} = (F, \theta)\), then \(\vec{F} = F \cos \theta \, \hat{i} + F \sin \theta \, \hat{j}\)

(5) If \(\theta \in \left]0, \frac{\pi}{2}\right[\), then the magnitude of the two components \((R \cos \theta)\), \((R \sin \theta)\) is less than the magnitude of the force (R) because \(\theta \in \left]0, \frac{\pi}{2}\right[\), thus \(0 < \sin \theta < 1\), \(0 < \cos \theta < 1\).

(6) If a body of weight (w) is placed on a smooth inclined plane with the horizontal by an angle \(\theta\), then we can resolve the weight (w) which acts vertically downwards into two components.

* \(F_1\) (The magnitude of the component in the direction of the line of the greatest slope)  
  \(= w \sin \theta\)

* \(F_2\) (The magnitude of the component in the perpendicular direction on the plane)  
  \(= w \cos \theta\)

- The magnitude of the component which is in the East direction  
  \[
  F \cos 45^\circ = 8 \sqrt{2} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 8 \text{ newton}.

# Lesson Two

## Example 4

A force of magnitude \(10 \sqrt{3}\) kg.wt. was resolved into two perpendicular components, one of them is of magnitude 15 kg.wt. Find the magnitude of the other component.

### Solution

Let the direction of the given component \(\vec{F_1}\) inclines on the direction of the force by an angle of measure \(\theta\).

- The magnitude of this component \(\vec{F_1} = 10 \sqrt{3} \cos \theta\)
- Given: \(15 = 10 \sqrt{3} \cos \theta\)
- Therefore, \(\cos \theta = \frac{15}{10 \sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\)
- Hence, \(\theta = 30^\circ\)

The magnitude of the other component \(F_2 = 10 \sqrt{3} \sin 30^\circ = 10 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = 5 \sqrt{3}\) kg.wt.

----

### Another solution:

\[
R = \sqrt{F_1^2 + F_2^2}
\]

\[
\left(10 \sqrt{3}\right)^2 = 15^2 + F_2^2
\]

\[
F_2^2 = 75

\[
F_2 = 5 \sqrt{3} \text{ kg.wt.}

### Solution

From the figure, we notice that: \(m(\angle BCD) = m(\angle BAC) = 30^\circ\)

- \(F_1 =\) (the magnitude of the component in the direction of the line of the greatest slope)

\[
= W \sin 30^\circ = 50 \times \frac{1}{2} = 25 \text{ newton}
\]

- \(F_2 =\) (the magnitude of the component in the perpendicular direction to the plane)

## The resultant of coplanar forces meeting at a point

### 1. The geometrical method

Suppose that the system of coplanar forces \(\vec{F}_1, \vec{F}_2, \vec{F}_3, \vec{F}_4\) acts at point M as in the opposite figure.

To find the resultant of these forces:

* Use an appropriate drawing scale.
* From any point as A draw the vector \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) to represent \(\vec{F}_1\) (in magnitude and direction).
* From point B draw the vector \(\overrightarrow{BC}\) to represent \(\vec{F}_2\).
* From point C draw the vector \(\overrightarrow{CD}\) to represent \(\vec{F}_3\).
* At last, from point D draw the vector \(\overrightarrow{DE}\) to represent \(\vec{F}_4\).

Match the first point (A) to the last point (E) to be the vector \(\overrightarrow{AE}\) which represents the resultant \(\vec{R}\) in magnitude and direction, where

$$
\vec{R} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 + \vec{F}_3 + \vec{F}_4
$$

* Find the length of \(\overrightarrow{AE}\) and \(m(\angle EAB)\). Assume it is the included angle between the resultant and the first force, and using the drawing scale we can find the magnitude and the direction of \(\vec{R}\).
* Then the resultant of the set of forces is a force of magnitude \(R\) and acts at point M in direction \(\overrightarrow{AE}\).

> **Notice that:**  
> The vector \(\overrightarrow{AE}\) which represents \(\vec{R}\) has an opposite direction to the other directions of vectors which represent the forces, and the polygon ABCDE is called "The force polygon".

### Figures described:

- A diagram showing four forces \(\vec{F}_1, \vec{F}_2, \vec{F}_3, \vec{F}_4\) acting at point M with resultant \(\vec{R}\).
- A polygon ABCDE formed by vectors \(\overrightarrow{AB} = \vec{F}_1\), \(\overrightarrow{BC} = \vec{F}_2\), \(\overrightarrow{CD} = \vec{F}_3\), \(\overrightarrow{DE} = \vec{F}_4\), and \(\overrightarrow{AE} = \vec{R}\).



---


# Lesson Three

> **Remark**  
> If the first and last points are congruent in the force polygon, then \(\vec{R} = \vec{0}\) and the set of forces are equilibrium.  
> *i.e.* The adjusted and sufficient condition to equilibrium a set of concurrent forces is a representing of these forces geometrically by the sides of a closed polygon taken in the same direction.

## 2 The analytical method

Suppose that the system of coplanar forces \(\vec{F}_1, \vec{F}_2, \vec{F}_3, \ldots, \vec{F}_n\) meet at the point \(O\) and the point \(O\) is the origin point of a coplanar Cartesian axis.

And \(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \ldots, \theta_n\) are the polar angles of the forces \(\vec{F}_1, \vec{F}_2, \vec{F}_3, \ldots, \vec{F}_n\) respectively, let \(\vec{i}\) and \(\vec{j}\) be the fundamental unit vectors in the two directions \(\overrightarrow{OX}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OY}\), then:

\[
\vec{F}_1 = (F_1, \theta_1) = F_1 \cos \theta_1 \, \vec{i} + F_1 \sin \theta_1 \, \vec{j}
\]

\[
\vec{F}_2 = (F_2, \theta_2) = F_2 \cos \theta_2 \, \vec{i} + F_2 \sin \theta_2 \, \vec{j}
\]

\[
\vec{F}_3 = (F_3, \theta_3) = F_3 \cos \theta_3 \, \vec{i} + F_3 \sin \theta_3 \, \vec{j}
\]

and so on till:

\[
\vec{F}_n = (F_n, \theta_n) = F_n \cos \theta_n \, \vec{i} + F_n \sin \theta_n \, \vec{j}
\]

Therefore:

\[
\vec{R} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 + \vec{F}_3 + \ldots + \vec{F}_n
\]

Then by adding we get:

\[
\vec{R} = (F_1 \cos \theta_1 \, \vec{i} + F_1 \sin \theta_1 \, \vec{j}) + (F_2 \cos \theta_2 \, \vec{i} + F_2 \sin \theta_2 \, \vec{j}) + (F_3 \cos \theta_3 \, \vec{i} + F_3 \sin \theta_3 \, \vec{j}) + \ldots + (F_n \cos \theta_n \, \vec{i} + F_n \sin \theta_n \, \vec{j})
\]

\[
= (F_1 \cos \theta_1 + F_2 \cos \theta_2 + F_3 \cos \theta_3 + \ldots + F_n \cos \theta_n) \vec{i} + (F_1 \sin \theta_1 + F_2 \sin \theta_2 + F_3 \sin \theta_3 + \ldots + F_n \sin \theta_n) \vec{j}
\]

\[
\text{i.e.} \quad \vec{R} = \left( \sum_{r=1}^n F_r \cos \theta_r \right) \vec{i} + \left( \sum_{r=1}^n F_r \sin \theta_r \right) \vec{j}
\]

The expression \(\sum_{r=1}^n F_r \cos \theta_r\) is called the algebraic sum of the components in the direction \(\overrightarrow{OX}\) and is denoted by \(X\), and the expression \(\sum_{r=1}^n F_r \sin \theta_r\) is called the algebraic sum of the components in the direction \(\overrightarrow{OY}\) and is denoted by \(Y\). Hence, we can write the previous equation in the form:

\[
\vec{R} = X \vec{i} + Y \vec{j}
\]

----

[The page also contains a diagram showing the forces \(\vec{F}_1, \vec{F}_2, \vec{F}_3, \ldots, \vec{F}_n\) acting at point \(O\) with angles \(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \ldots, \theta_n\) measured from the \(x\)-axis, and unit vectors \(\vec{i}\) and \(\vec{j}\) along the \(x\) and \(y\) axes respectively.]


---


# Unit 1

And let **R** be the magnitude of \(\vec{R}\) and \(\alpha\) is the measure of the polar angle of the resultant \(\vec{R}\), then:

$$
R = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2} \quad \text{and} \quad \tan \alpha = \frac{Y}{X}
$$

where \(\vec{R} = (R, \alpha)\)

----

## Remarks

1. Notice the difference between \(X\) and \(\vec{i}\):

   * \(X\) is the algebraic sum of the components of forces in the direction of \(\overrightarrow{OX}\)
   * \(\vec{i}\) is the fundamental unit vector in the direction of \(\overrightarrow{OX}\)

2. If \(X = 0\), then \(\vec{R} = Y \vec{j}\)

   * and \(\theta = 90^\circ\), if \(\vec{R}\) is in the direction \(\overrightarrow{OY}\)
   * \(\theta = 270^\circ\), if \(\vec{R}\) is in the direction \(-\overrightarrow{OY}\)

3. If \(Y = 0\), then \(\vec{R} = X \vec{i}\)

   * and \(\theta = 0^\circ\), if \(\vec{R}\) is in the direction \(\overrightarrow{OX}\)
   * \(\theta = 180^\circ\), if \(\vec{R}\) is in the direction \(-\overrightarrow{OX}\)

4. If \(X = 0\) and \(Y = 0\), then \(\vec{R} = \vec{0}\)

   In this case, the set of coplanar concurrent forces are in equilibrium.

5. To determine the direction of the resultant, consider that:

6. The resultant of set of forces \(\vec{F}_1, \vec{F}_2, \vec{F}_3\)

   $$
   \vec{R} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 + \vec{F}_3
   $$

   and if

   $$
   \vec{R} = \vec{0}
   $$

   then the set of forces are in equilibrium.

----

### For Example:

If

$$
\vec{F}_1 = 5 \vec{i} + 2 \vec{j}, \quad \vec{F}_2 = -6 \vec{i} + 3 \vec{j}
$$

and

$$
\vec{F}_3 = \vec{i} - 5 \vec{j}
$$

then

$$
\vec{R} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 + \vec{F}_3 = \vec{0}
$$

Therefore, the forces are in equilibrium.


---


# Lesson Three

## Example 1

If the forces \(\vec{F_1} = 5 \vec{i} - 4 \vec{j}\), \(\vec{F_2} = -6 \vec{i} + a \vec{j}\) and \(\vec{F_3} = b \vec{i} + 7 \vec{j}\) are meeting at a point and are in equilibrium. Find the value of each of: \(a\) and \(b\).

### Solution

- The forces are in equilibrium  
  \[
  \vec{F_1} + \vec{F_2} + \vec{F_3} = \vec{0}
  \]
- Substitute the forces:  
  \[
  (5 \vec{i} - 4 \vec{j}) + (-6 \vec{i} + a \vec{j}) + (b \vec{i} + 7 \vec{j}) = \vec{0}
  \]
- Grouping components:  
  \[
  (-1 + b) \vec{i} + (3 + a) \vec{j} = \vec{0}
  \]
- Equate components to zero:  
  \[
  -1 + b = 0 \implies b = 1
  \]
  \[
  3 + a = 0 \implies a = -3
  \]

## Example 2

In each of the following three figures, a set of forces meeting at a point \(O\) and their magnitudes are in newton unit.  
Determine the magnitude and the direction of the resultant of each of them.

### Figures

| Fig. (1)                          | Fig. (2)                          | Fig. (3)                          |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Forces: 3, \(5\sqrt{2}\), 8      | Forces: 3, \(4\sqrt{3}\), \(2\sqrt{3}\) | Forces: \(3\sqrt{3}\), \(7\sqrt{3}\), 6, \(2\sqrt{3}\) |
| Angles: 0°, 45°, 90°             | Angles: 0°, 30°, 30°             | Angles: 30°, 30°, 60°, 0°        |

### Solution

**In Fig. (1):**  
The three forces whose magnitudes are 8, \(5\sqrt{2}\), and 3 newton and their polar angles are of measures 0°, 45°, and 90° respectively.

- The algebraic sum of the components in the direction of \(OX\) is:  
  \[
  X = 8 \cos 0^\circ + 5\sqrt{2} \cos 45^\circ + 3 \cos 90^\circ
  \]
  \[
  = 8 \times 1 + 5\sqrt{2} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 3 \times 0 = 8 + 5 + 0 = 13 \text{ newton}
  \]

- The algebraic sum of the components in the direction of \(OY\) is:  
  \[
  Y = 8 \sin 0^\circ + 5\sqrt{2} \sin 45^\circ + 3 \sin 90^\circ
  \]
  \[
  = 8 \times 0 + 5\sqrt{2} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 3 \times 1 = 0 + 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ newton}
  \]

- Resultant vector:  
  \[
  \vec{R} = 13 \vec{i} + 8 \vec{j}
  \]
  \[
  R = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2} = \sqrt{169 + 64} = \sqrt{233} \approx 15.264 \text{ newton}
  \]

- Direction angle \(\alpha\):  
  \[
  \tan \alpha = \frac{Y}{X} = \frac{8}{13}
  \]
  Since \(X > 0\) and \(Y > 0\), \(\vec{R}\) lies in the first quadrant. Using a calculator:  
  \[
  \alpha \approx 31^\circ 36'
  \]

# Unit 1

## In Fig. (2):

The three forces whose magnitudes are \(3\), \(4\sqrt{3}\), and \(2\sqrt{3}\) newton and their polar angles are of measures \(180^\circ\), \(270^\circ\), and \(330^\circ\) respectively.

$$
X = 3 \cos 180^\circ + 4 \sqrt{3} \cos 270^\circ + 2 \sqrt{3} \cos 330^\circ
$$

$$
= 3 \times (-1) + 4 \sqrt{3} \times 0 + 2 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -3 + 0 + 3 = \text{zero}
$$

$$
Y = 3 \sin 180^\circ + 4 \sqrt{3} \sin 270^\circ + 2 \sqrt{3} \sin 330^\circ
$$

$$
= 3 \times 0 + 4 \sqrt{3} \times (-1) + 2 \sqrt{3} \times \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)
$$

$$
= 0 - 4 \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{3} = -5 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}.
$$

Therefore,

$$
\vec{R} = -5 \sqrt{3} \mathbf{j}
$$

Then,

$$
R = 5 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton and } \alpha = 270^\circ
$$

----

## In Fig. (3):

Four forces of magnitudes \(7 \sqrt{3}\), \(3 \sqrt{3}\), \(6\), and \(2 \sqrt{3}\) newton and their polar angles are of measures \(30^\circ\), \(150^\circ\), \(240^\circ\), and \(270^\circ\) respectively.

$$
X = 7 \sqrt{3} \cos 30^\circ + 3 \sqrt{3} \cos 150^\circ + 6 \cos 240^\circ + 2 \sqrt{3} \cos 270^\circ
$$

$$
= 7 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 3 \sqrt{3} \times \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + 6 \times \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 2 \sqrt{3} \times 0
$$

$$
= 10.5 - 4.5 - 3 + 0 = 3 \text{ newton},
$$

$$
Y = 7 \sqrt{3} \sin 30^\circ + 3 \sqrt{3} \sin 150^\circ + 6 \sin 240^\circ + 2 \sqrt{3} \sin 270^\circ
$$

$$
= 7 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{1}{2} + 3 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{1}{2} + 6 \times \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + 2 \sqrt{3} \times (-1)
$$

$$
= \frac{7 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{3} - 2 \sqrt{3} = \text{zero}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\vec{R} = 3 \mathbf{i}, \quad \text{then } R = 3 \text{ newton}, \quad \alpha = 0
$$

----

### Another solution for the figure (3):

Using the analyzing of the forces into two perpendicular directions:

$$
X = 7 \sqrt{3} \cos 30^\circ - 3 \sqrt{3} \cos 30^\circ - 6 \cos 60^\circ
$$

$$
= 7 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 6 \times \frac{1}{2} = 3 \text{ newton}.
$$

$$
Y = 3 \sqrt{3} \sin 30^\circ + 7 \sqrt{3} \sin 30^\circ - 6 \sin 60^\circ - 2 \sqrt{3}
$$

$$
= 3 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{1}{2} + 7 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{1}{2} - 6 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 2 \sqrt{3} = 0
$$

Therefore,

$$
R = \sqrt{(3)^2 + (0)^2} = 3 \text{ newton}.
$$

$$
\tan \alpha = \frac{Y}{X} = \frac{0}{3} = 0 \quad \therefore \quad \alpha = 0^\circ
$$

# Lesson Three

## Example 3

Five coplanar forces meeting at a point, their magnitudes are 12, 9, 5√2, 7√2 and 7 kg.wt., act in the directions: East, North, Western North, Western South and South respectively. Prove that the set of these forces are in equilibrium.

### Solution

The forces are  
$$(12, 0^\circ), (9, 90^\circ), (5\sqrt{2}, 135^\circ), (7\sqrt{2}, 225^\circ), (7, 270^\circ)$$

$$X = 12 \cos 0^\circ + 9 \cos 90^\circ + 5\sqrt{2} \cos 135^\circ + 7\sqrt{2} \cos 225^\circ + 7 \cos 270^\circ$$  
$$= 12 \times 1 + 0 + 5\sqrt{2} \times \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + 7\sqrt{2} \times \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + 0$$  
$$= 12 - 5 - 7 = 0$$

$$Y = 12 \sin 0^\circ + 9 \sin 90^\circ + 5\sqrt{2} \sin 135^\circ + 7\sqrt{2} \sin 225^\circ + 7 \sin 270^\circ$$  
$$= 0 + 9 + 5\sqrt{2} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 7\sqrt{2} \times \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + 7 \times (-1)$$  
$$= 9 + 5 - 7 - 7 = 0$$

Therefore,  
$$X = 0, \quad Y = 0 \implies \vec{R} = \vec{0}$$

The set of forces are in equilibrium.

----

## Example 4

Four coplanar forces meeting at a point and their magnitudes are \(F\), \(2F\), \(3\sqrt{3}F\) and \(4F\) kg.wt. The measure of the angle between the first and second forces is \(60^\circ\) and between the second and the third is \(90^\circ\) and between the third and the fourth is \(150^\circ\). Find the magnitude and the direction of \(\vec{R}\).

### Solution

Let \(OX\) be the direction of the first force, then the forces in polar form are  
$$(F, 0^\circ), (2F, 60^\circ), (3\sqrt{3}F, 150^\circ), (4F, 300^\circ)$$  
respectively.

$$X = F \cos 0^\circ + 2F \cos 60^\circ + 3\sqrt{3}F \cos 150^\circ + 4F \cos 300^\circ$$  
$$= F \times 1 + 2F \times \frac{1}{2} + 3\sqrt{3}F \times \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + 4F \times \frac{1}{2}$$  
$$= F + F - \frac{9}{2}F + 2F = -\frac{1}{2}F$$

$$Y = F \sin 0^\circ + 2F \sin 60^\circ + 3\sqrt{3}F \sin 150^\circ + 4F \sin 300^\circ$$  
$$= F \times 0 + 2F \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 3\sqrt{3}F \times \frac{1}{2} + 4F \times \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$$  
$$= 0 + \sqrt{3}F + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}F - 2\sqrt{3}F = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}F$$

### Diagrams (descriptions)

- Example 3 diagram:  
  A coordinate system with directions East, North, West, South marked. Forces are shown at angles 0°, 90°, 135°, 225°, and 270° with magnitudes 12, 9, 5√2, 7√2, and 7 respectively.

- Example 4 diagram:  
  A coordinate system with forces at 0°, 60°, 150°, and 300° with magnitudes \(F\), \(2F\), \(3\sqrt{3}F\), and \(4F\) respectively, showing the resultant vector \(\vec{R}\).



---


# UNIT 1

$$
\vec{R} = -\frac{1}{2} F \hat{i} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} F \hat{j} \quad \therefore R = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2}F\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}F\right)^2} = \sqrt{F^2} = F
$$

$$
\therefore R = F, \quad \tan \alpha = \frac{Y}{X} = \frac{\sqrt{3}F/2}{-2/F} = -\sqrt{3}
$$

$$
\therefore X < 0, \quad Y > 0 \quad \therefore \alpha = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ
$$

_i.e._ The resultant magnitude is \(F\) and its direction between 2\textsuperscript{nd} and 3\textsuperscript{rd} forces making an angle of measure \(30^\circ\) with the 3\textsuperscript{rd} force.

*Try to solve this example using the analyzing of the forces into two perpendicular directions.*

----

## Example 5

**Three forces of magnitudes \(2F\), \(4F\), \(6F\) act at a point in directions parallel to the sides of an equilateral triangle in the same cyclic order. Find the magnitude and the direction of the resultant.**

### Solution

Let the forces act at the point \(O\) in the directions \(\overrightarrow{OX}, \overrightarrow{OL}, \overrightarrow{OM}\) which are parallel to the directions \(\overrightarrow{AB}, \overrightarrow{BC}, \overrightarrow{CA}\) in the equilateral triangle \(ABC\).

Then the forces in the polar form are:

\[
(2F, 0^\circ), \quad (4F, 120^\circ), \quad (6F, 240^\circ)
\]

Calculate the components:

\[
X = 2F \cos 0^\circ + 4F \cos 120^\circ + 6F \cos 240^\circ
\]

\[
= 2F \times 1 + 4F \times \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 6F \times \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -3F
\]

\[
Y = 2F \sin 0^\circ + 4F \sin 120^\circ + 6F \sin 240^\circ
\]

\[
= 2F \times 0 + 4F \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 6F \times \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = -\sqrt{3}F
\]

Therefore,

\[
\vec{R} = -3F \hat{i} - \sqrt{3}F \hat{j}
\]

Magnitude of resultant:

\[
R = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2} = \sqrt{(-3F)^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}F\right)^2} = \sqrt{12F^2} = 2\sqrt{3}F
\]

Direction:

\[
\tan \alpha = \frac{Y}{X} = \frac{-\sqrt{3}F}{-3F} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

Since \(X\) and \(Y\) are negative, then \(\alpha = 210^\circ\).

_i.e._ Resultant magnitude is \(2\sqrt{3}F\) and its direction between the two forces of magnitudes \(6F\), \(4F\) making an angle of measure \(30^\circ\) with the force \(6F\).

*Try to solve this example using the resolution of the forces into two perpendicular directions.*

# Lesson Three

## Example 6

**ABCDEF is a regular hexagon. Forces of magnitudes**  
$$6, \quad 2\sqrt{3}, \quad 6, \quad 2\sqrt{3}$$  
**newton act along** \(\overrightarrow{AB}\), \(\overrightarrow{AC}\), \(\overrightarrow{AD}\), and \(\overrightarrow{AE}\) **respectively.**  
Find the magnitude and the direction of the resultant of these forces.

----

### Solution

Suppose \(\overrightarrow{OX}\) is the direction of the first force.

Then the polar form of the forces are:  
\[
(6, 0^\circ), \quad \left(2\sqrt{3}, 30^\circ\right), \quad (6, 60^\circ), \quad \left(2\sqrt{3}, 90^\circ\right)
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
X &= 6 \cos 0^\circ + 2\sqrt{3} \cos 30^\circ + 6 \cos 60^\circ + 2\sqrt{3} \cos 90^\circ \\
&= 6 \times 1 + 2\sqrt{3} \times \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + 6 \times \frac{1}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \times 0 = 12 \text{ newton}
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
Y &= 6 \sin 0^\circ + 2\sqrt{3} \sin 30^\circ + 6 \sin 60^\circ + 2\sqrt{3} \sin 90^\circ \\
&= 6 \times 0 + 2\sqrt{3} \times \frac{1}{2} + 6 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \times 1 = 6\sqrt{3} \text{ newton}
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\overrightarrow{R} = 12 \mathbf{i} + 6\sqrt{3} \mathbf{j}
\]

\[
R = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2} = \sqrt{12^2 + \left(6\sqrt{3}\right)^2} = 6\sqrt{7} \text{ newton}
\]

\[
\tan \alpha = \frac{Y}{X} = \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{12} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Since \(X > 0, Y > 0\),  
\[
\alpha = 40^\circ 53' 36''
\]

**i.e.** The resultant magnitude is \(6\sqrt{7}\) N,  
and its direction is between \(\overrightarrow{AC}\) and \(\overrightarrow{AD}\) making an angle of measure \(10^\circ 53' 36''\) with \(\overrightarrow{AC}\).

**Using the resolution of the forces into two perpendicular directions:**

\[
X = 6 \cos 60^\circ + 2\sqrt{3} \cos 30^\circ + 6
\]

\[
= 6 \times \frac{1}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 6 = 12 \text{ newton}
\]

\[
Y = 6 \sin 60^\circ + 2\sqrt{3} \sin 30^\circ + 2\sqrt{3}
\]

\[
= 6 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \times \frac{1}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} = 6\sqrt{3} \text{ newton}
\]

\[
R = \sqrt{12^2 + \left(6\sqrt{3}\right)^2} = 6\sqrt{7} \text{ newton}
\]

\[
\tan \alpha = \frac{Y}{X} = \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{12} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

\[
\alpha = 40^\circ 53' 36''
\]

**i.e.** The resultant magnitude is \(6\sqrt{7}\) N, and its direction between \(\overrightarrow{AC}\) and \(\overrightarrow{AD}\) making an angle of measure \(10^\circ 53' 36''\) with \(\overrightarrow{AC}\).

### Diagrams (descriptions):

- A regular hexagon \(ABCDEF\) is shown with forces acting along \(\overrightarrow{AB}\), \(\overrightarrow{AC}\), \(\overrightarrow{AD}\), and \(\overrightarrow{AE}\).
- The forces have magnitudes \(6\), \(2\sqrt{3}\), \(6\), and \(2\sqrt{3}\) respectively.
- Angles of \(30^\circ\) between the directions are marked.
- Coordinate axes \(x\) and \(y\) are drawn with the direction of the first force along \(OX\).

# UNIT 1

## Example 7

Four coplanar forces meeting at a point their magnitudes are \( F_1, 6\sqrt{2}, 8\sqrt{2}, F_2 \) gm.wt.  
The first force in the East direction, the second force is in the direction of Eastern North, the third is in the direction of Western North and the fourth acts in South direction.  
If their resultant is 7 gm.wt. in magnitude and acts in the East direction, find the value of \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \).

### Solution

The magnitude of the resultant is 7 gm. wt. and acts towards East

\[
\therefore X = 7 \text{ and } Y = 0
\]

\[
\therefore F_1 \cos 0^\circ + 6\sqrt{2} \cos 45^\circ + 8\sqrt{2} \cos 135^\circ + F_2 \cos 270^\circ = 7
\]

\[
\therefore F_1 \times 1 + 6\sqrt{2} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 8\sqrt{2} \times \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + F_2 \times 0 = 7
\]

\[
\therefore F_1 + 6 - 8 + 0 = 7 \quad \therefore F_1 = 9 \text{ gm. wt.}
\]

\[
F_1 \sin 0^\circ + 6\sqrt{2} \sin 45^\circ + 8\sqrt{2} \sin 135^\circ + F_2 \sin 270^\circ = 0
\]

\[
\therefore F_1 \times 0 + 6\sqrt{2} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 8\sqrt{2} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + F_2 \times (-1) = 0
\]

\[
\therefore 6 + 8 - F_2 = 0 \quad \therefore F_2 = 14 \text{ gm. wt.}
\]

*Try to solve this example using the resolution of the forces into two perpendicular directions.*

## Example 8

Five coplanar forces meeting at a point their magnitudes are \( F, 9, 5\sqrt{2}, 7\sqrt{2}, K \) (kg.wt.)  
The measure of the angle between the first force and the second force is \( 90^\circ \), between the second and the third is \( 45^\circ \), between the third and the fourth is \( 90^\circ \) and between the fourth and the fifth \( 45^\circ \). If the system of forces is in equilibrium, find the value of \( F \) and \( K \).

### Solution

Let \(\overrightarrow{OX}\) be the direction of the first force,  
then the forces in the polar form are:

\[
(F, 0^\circ), (9, 90^\circ), (5\sqrt{2}, 135^\circ), (7\sqrt{2}, 225^\circ), (K, 270^\circ)
\]

\[
\therefore \text{the forces are in equilibrium}
\]

\[
\therefore X = Y = 0
\]

&X = F \cos 0^\circ + 9 \cos 90^\circ + 5 \sqrt{2} \cos 135^\circ + 7 \sqrt{2} \cos 225^\circ + K \cos 270^\circ \\
&\therefore F + 9 \times 0 + 5 \sqrt{2} \times -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 7 \sqrt{2} \times -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + K \times 0 = 0 \quad \therefore F = 12 \\

### Solution

In \(\triangle ABC\):

$$

$$

&= 6 \times 1 + 20 \times (-\cos \theta) + 13 \sqrt{2} \times \cos 45^\circ + 2 \times 0 \\
&= 6 - 20 \times \frac{4}{5} + 13 \sqrt{2} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 0 \\
&= 6 - 16 + 13 = 3 \text{ newton}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y &= 6 \sin 0^\circ + 20 \sin (180^\circ + \theta) + 13 \sqrt{2} \sin \alpha + 2 \sin 90^\circ \\
&= 6 \times 0 + 20 \times (-\sin \theta) + 13 \sqrt{2} \times \sin 45^\circ + 2 \times 1 \\
&= 0 - 20 \times \frac{3}{5} + 13 \sqrt{2} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 2 \\
&= 0 - 12 + 13 + 2 = 3 \text{ newton}

# Lesson 4

## Equilibrium of a rigid body under the effect of two forces / three forces meeting at a point  
*(The triangle of forces rule - Lami’s rule)*

----

### First  
**Equilibrium of a rigid body under the action of two forces:**

**The conditions of equilibrium of a rigid body under the action of two forces**

The rigid body is in equilibrium under the action of two forces only, if the two forces:  
1. Are equal in magnitude.  
2. Are opposite in direction.  
3. Their lines of action are on the same straight line.

----

### Examples on the equilibrium of a body under the action of two forces:

#### (1) A body suspended by a light string:  
If a weight (W) is suspended by a light string. It balances under the action of two forces which are: weight (W) acting vertically downwards and the tension in the string (T) acting vertically upwards therefore:  
$$ T = W $$

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>↑ T</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>●</td>
    <td>↓ W</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### (2) A body of weight W placed on a horizontal smooth plane:  
If a body of weight (W) is placed on a smooth horizontal plane. It balances under the action of two forces which are: weight (W) acting vertically downwards and the reaction of the horizontal smooth plane (r) acting vertically upwards as shown in the figure.  

We deduce that:  
$$ r = W $$

    <td></td>
    <td>↑ r</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>■</td>
    <td>↓ W</td>
  </tr>
</table>

# UNIT 1

## Remarks

1. If a rigid body is acted upon by two forces equal in magnitude, opposite in direction and their lines of action are on the same straight line, they have no effect on the body neither in case of rest nor motion.

2. **In the opposite figure:**  
   If a string passes over a smooth pulley, and two bodies A and B are suspended from its two terminals such that the string is tensioned, then the two tensions in the two terminals of the string are equal in magnitude.

   ```
   Diagram:
       Pulley with string passing over it
       Tensions T acting upward on both sides

   ```

3. **In the opposite figure:**  
   If a string passes through a smooth ring to be suspended freely in it, then the tensions in each of the two branches of the string AB, AC are equal in magnitude.

   ```
   Diagram:
       Smooth ring with string passing through it
       Tensions T acting along branches AB and AC
   ```

----

## Second: Equilibrium of a rigid body under the action of three forces acting at a point

If three coplanar forces as $\vec{F_1}$, $\vec{F_2}$, and $\vec{F_3}$ are acting at a point and they are in equilibrium as shown in the figure, and if $\vec{R_{1,2}}$ is the resultant of the two forces $\vec{F_1}$ and $\vec{F_2}$, then the two forces, $\vec{R_{1,2}}$ and $\vec{F_3}$ are balanced. Then from the conditions of the equilibrium of two forces, we deduce that $\vec{R_{1,2}}$ and $\vec{F_3}$ are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction and they have the same line of action.

**Generally:**  
If three forces acting at a point are in equilibrium, then the resultant of any two forces of them is equal in magnitude to the third force and acts in the opposite direction of it and they have the same line of action.

```
Diagram:
    Three forces F1, F2, F3 acting at a point with resultant R1,2 of F1 and F2
```

----

## Example 1

$\vec{F_1}$, $\vec{F_2}$, and $\vec{F_3}$ are three coplanar forces meeting at a point, their magnitudes are 12, $12\sqrt{3}$, and 24 newton respectively. If these forces are balanced, find the measures of the angles among the three lines of action of the three forces.

### Solution

Suppose the measure of the angle between the lines of action of $\vec{F_1}$ and $\vec{F_2}$ be $\theta_3$.

- The three forces are balanced.
- $R_{1,2} = F_3 = 24$ and act in the opposite direction.
- $$(R_{1,2})^2 = F_1^2 + F_2^2 + 2 F_1 F_2 \cos \theta_3$$

```
Diagram:
    Forces F1, F2, F3 acting at a point with angles θ1, θ2, θ3 between them
```


---


# Lesson Four

$$
\therefore (24)^2 = (12)^2 + \left(12 \sqrt{3}\right)^2 + 2 \times 12 \times 12 \sqrt{3} \cos \theta_3
$$

$$
\therefore 576 = 144 + 432 + 288 \sqrt{3} \cos \theta_3
$$

$$
\therefore \cos \theta_3 = 0 \quad \therefore \theta_3 = 90^\circ
$$

Similarly, suppose the measure of the angle between the lines of action of $\vec{F}_2$ and $\vec{F}_3$ is $\theta_1$,  
$$
\therefore \text{the three forces are balanced.}
$$

$$
\therefore R_{2,3} = F_1 = 12 \text{ and act in the opposite direction.}
$$

$$
\therefore (R_{2,3})^2 = F_2^2 + F_3^2 + 2 F_2 F_3 \cos \theta_1
$$

$$
\therefore 144 = 432 + 576 + 2 \times 12 \sqrt{3} \times 24 \cos \theta_1 \quad \therefore \cos \theta_1 = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
$$

$$
\therefore \theta_1 = 150^\circ
$$

$$
\therefore \theta_2 \text{ (the measure of the angle between the lines of action of } \vec{F}_1 \text{ and } \vec{F}_3) = 360^\circ - (90^\circ + 150^\circ) = 120^\circ
$$

* We know that, the adjusted and sufficient condition to equilibrium of a rigid body under acting of a set of concurrent forces is a representing of these forces geometrically by the sides of a closed polygon, then we can deduce the following rule.

----

## Rule (1)

If three forces are acting at a point and can be represented by the sides of a triangle taken in the same cyclic order, then the forces are in equilibrium.

### In the opposite figure:

If $\vec{F}_1$, $\vec{F}_2$ and $\vec{F}_3$ are three coplanar forces meeting at A and the vectors $\overrightarrow{AB}$, $\overrightarrow{BC}$ and $\overrightarrow{CA}$ represent these forces in magnitude and direction,

$$
\therefore \overrightarrow{AC} = \overrightarrow{AB} + \overrightarrow{BC}
$$

$$
\therefore \overrightarrow{AC} \text{ represents the resultant of the two forces } \vec{F}_1 \text{ and } \vec{F}_2
$$

but $\overrightarrow{CA}$ represents $\vec{F}_3$,

$$
\therefore \overrightarrow{AC} + \overrightarrow{CA} = \vec{0}
$$

$$
\therefore \vec{F}_3 \text{ equals in magnitude and opposite in direction to the resultant of } \vec{F}_1 \text{ and } \vec{F}_2
$$

i.e. $\vec{F}_3$ is balanced with the resultant of the two forces $\vec{F}_1$ and $\vec{F}_2$.

$$
\therefore \text{The three forces are in equilibrium}
$$

# UNIT 1

## Remark

The three coplanar non collinear forces acting at a point. In order to be in equilibrium, their magnitude should be formed to be lengths of sides of a triangle.  
_i.e._ The greatest magnitude of these forces should be less than the sum of the other two magnitudes of the other two forces because in any triangle, the longest side should be less than the sum of two lengths of the other two sides.  

**For example:**  
The three forces whose magnitudes are 3, 4 and 9 force unit cannot be in equilibrium because the numbers 3, 4 and 9 cannot be lengths of sides of any triangle because \(9 > 3 + 4\) but the forces whose magnitudes are 4, 7, 8 could be in equilibrium, but we cannot say that they are in equilibrium because that is depending on their magnitudes and their directions also.  
* Three forces act at a point equilibrate if the magnitude of the greatest force equals the sum of the magnitudes of the other two forces in case they act on the same straight line.

----

## Rule (2) _The triangle of forces rule_

If a rigid body is in equilibrium under the action of three forces acting at a point and a triangle is drawn whose sides are parallel to the lines of action of the forces and taken in the same cyclic order, then the lengths of the sides of the triangle are proportional to the magnitudes of the corresponding forces.

And if we symbolized the forces' magnitude by \(F_1\), \(F_2\), and \(F_3\), and \(\triangle ABC\) was the triangle whose sides are parallel to the lines of action of three forces then \(AB\), \(BC\), and \(CA\) represent the forces \(F_1\), \(F_2\), and \(F_3\) respectively in the magnitude and the direction where the body is in equilibrium, then

$$
\frac{F_1}{AB} = \frac{F_2}{BC} = \frac{F_3}{AC}
$$

and \(\triangle ABC\) is called "the triangle of forces".  

It is noted that we can draw an infinite number of similar triangles; each of them is called the triangle of forces.

----

## Example 2

**Three forces of magnitudes \(F_1\), \(F_2\), and 96 kg.wt. act on a particle. They are represented by the directed line segments \(AB\), \(BC\), and \(CA\) respectively in \(\triangle ABC\), where \(AB = 8 \text{ cm}\), \(BC = 10 \text{ cm}\), and \(CA = 12 \text{ cm}\). Find the value of each of \(F_1\) and \(F_2\).**

### Solution

* The forces are represented by the directed line segments of a triangle taken in one direction.  
* The three forces are balanced, then using the triangle of forces rule we get:

$$
\frac{F_1}{AB} = \frac{F_2}{BC} = \frac{96}{CA}
$$

$$
\therefore \quad \frac{F_1}{8} = \frac{F_2}{10} = \frac{96}{12}
$$

$$
\therefore F_1 = 64 \text{ kg.wt.}, \quad F_2 = 80 \text{ kg.wt.}
$$


---


# Lesson Four

## Important remarks:

1. It is possible to draw the triangle of forces, such that two of its sides are on the line of action of two forces and the third side is parallel to the line of action of the third force.

   **As in the opposite figure:**

   \(\triangle ABC\) is the triangle of forces.

   ```
   Diagram:
   Triangle ABC with forces F1, F2, F3 acting along sides:
   - Side AB parallel to F1
   - Side BC parallel to F2
   - Side CA parallel to F3
   ```

2. * If the triangle of forces of three equilibrium forces is a right-angled triangle and it has an angle of measure \(30^\circ\), then the ratio among its side lengths is \(1 : 2 : \sqrt{3}\).

   * If the triangle of forces is isosceles right-angled triangle, then the ratio among its side lengths is \(1 : 1 : \sqrt{2}\).

   ```
   Diagrams:
   - Right angled triangle with angles 30°, 60°, 90° and sides 1, 2, √3
   - Isosceles right angled triangle with angles 45°, 45°, 90° and sides 1, 1, √2
   ```

## Enrich knowledge

If a triangle is drawn in which its sides are perpendicular to the directions of the equilibrium, then the ratio between each force and the length of the side perpendicular to it is equal.

**In the opposite figure:**

$$
\vec{W} \perp AC, \quad \vec{T_1} \perp BC, \quad \vec{T_2} \perp AB
$$

$$
\therefore \quad \frac{W}{AC} = \frac{T_1}{BC} = \frac{T_2}{AB}
$$

This rule is called **perpendicular of forces triangle**.

```
Diagram:
Triangle ABC with forces W, T1, T2 acting such that:
- W perpendicular to AC
- T1 perpendicular to BC
- T2 perpendicular to AB
```

## Rule (3) - Lami's rule

If three coplanar forces meeting at a point and acting upon a particle are in equilibrium, then the magnitude of each force is proportional to the sine of the angle between the two other forces.

If the symbols of the magnitudes of the forces are \(F_1, F_2, F_3\), and \(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3\) are the measures of the opposite angles for them respectively as shown in the opposite figure:

Then \(\triangle BCA\) is the triangle of forces.

```
Diagram:
Triangle BCA with forces F1, F2, F3 acting at vertices and opposite angles θ1, θ2, θ3 respectively.
```


---


$$
\therefore \quad \frac{F_1}{BC} = \frac{F_2}{CA} = \frac{F_3}{AB} \quad \quad (1)
$$

and from sin law:

$$
\therefore \quad \frac{BC}{\sin(180 - \theta_1)} = \frac{CA}{\sin(180 - \theta_2)} = \frac{AB}{\sin(180 - \theta_3)}
$$

$$
i.e. \quad \frac{BC}{\sin \theta_1} = \frac{CA}{\sin \theta_2} = \frac{AB}{\sin \theta_3} \quad \quad (2)
$$

From (1), (2) we deduce that

$$
\frac{F_1}{\sin \theta_1} = \frac{F_2}{\sin \theta_2} = \frac{F_3}{\sin \theta_3}
$$

----

### Example 3

**Three coplanar forces of magnitudes \(F_1\), \(F_2\) and 18 newton meeting at a particle in balance. If the measure of the angle between the line of action of 1st and 2nd forces is 90° and between the 2nd and the 3rd is 120° Find the value of each of \(F_1\) and \(F_2\).**

#### Solution

The measure of the angle between the 1st and 3rd forces = \(360^\circ - (90^\circ + 120^\circ) = 150^\circ\)

Due to Lami's rule we get:

$$
\frac{F_1}{\sin 120^\circ} = \frac{F_2}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{F_3}{\sin 90^\circ}
$$

$$
\therefore \quad \frac{F_1}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{F_2}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{18}{1}
$$

$$
\therefore \quad F_1 = 18 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 9 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}
$$

$$
F_2 = 18 \times \frac{1}{2} = 9 \text{ newton}
$$

----

### Equilibrium of a body placed on a smooth inclined plane

If a body of weight (W) is placed on a smooth inclined plane which inclines by an angle of measure \(\theta\) with the horizontal, then the body will be under the action of two forces:

* (1) The weight force \(\vec{W}\) acting vertically downwards.
* (2) The reaction force \(\vec{r}\) of the inclined plane and it acts in direction perpendicular to the plane.

These two forces cannot be in equilibrium because they have two different lines of action. Therefore, in order to be in equilibrium, a third force must act on the body.

It may be in one of the following forms:


---

## Example 4

A body of weight 5 kg.wt. is placed on a smooth plane inclined to the horizontal at an angle of measure 30°. It is pulled up the plane under the action of a force of magnitude \(F\) which its line of action coincides with the line of the greatest slope up the plane. Find \(F\) and the reaction of the plane.

### Solution

The body is in equilibrium under the action of forces of magnitudes \(F\), \(r\), and 5 kg.wt. as shown in the figure.

The measure of the angle between the two lines of action of the two first forces = 90°  
Between the 2nd and the 3rd = \(180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ\)  
Between the 3rd and the 1st = \(90^\circ + 30^\circ = 120^\circ\)

Applying Lami's rule we get:

$$
\frac{F}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{r}{\sin 120^\circ} = \frac{5}{\sin 90^\circ}
$$

i.e.,

$$
\frac{F}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{r}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{5}{1}
$$

Therefore,

$$
F = 5 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2 \frac{1}{2} \text{ kg.wt.}
$$

$$
r = 5 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{5 \sqrt{3}}{2} \text{ kg.wt.}
$$

  - \(r\) reaction force perpendicular to the plane

# UNIT 1

## Example 5

A body of weight 20 kg.wt. is placed on a smooth plane inclined to the horizontal with an angle of measure \(\alpha\) where \(\cos \alpha = \frac{4}{5}\).

The body is kept in equilibrium by a horizontal force of magnitude \(F\).

Find \(F\) and the reaction of the plane.

### Solution

The weight is in equilibrium under the action of forces of magnitudes \(F\), \(r\), and 20 kg.wt. Therefore, the measure of the angle between the 1st and 2nd forces = \(90^\circ + \alpha\), and between the 2nd and 3rd = \(180^\circ - \alpha\), and between the 3rd and the first = \(90^\circ\).

Applying Lami's rule we get:

$$
\frac{F}{\sin(180^\circ - \alpha)} = \frac{r}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{20}{\sin(90^\circ + \alpha)}
$$

i.e.,

$$
\frac{F}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{r}{1} = \frac{20}{\cos \alpha}
$$

Since \(\cos \alpha = \frac{4}{5}\), 

\[
\sin \alpha = \frac{3}{5}
\]

\[
\therefore \quad \frac{F}{\frac{3}{5}} = \frac{r}{1} = \frac{20}{\frac{4}{5}}
\]

\[
\therefore F = 20 \times \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{5}{4} = 15 \text{ kg.wt.}
\]

\[
r = 20 \times \frac{5}{4} = 25 \text{ kg.wt.}
\]

## General examples on the equilibrium of three coplanar concurrent forces

## Example 6

A weight of 200 gm.wt. is suspended by two strings of lengths 90 cm and 120 cm fixed in two horizontal points; the distance between them is 150 cm. Find the value of the tension in each of the two strings in case of equilibrium.

### Solution

\[
(90)^2 + (120)^2 = (150)^2
\]

\[
\therefore \triangle ABC \text{ is right-angled at } C, \text{ from the figure we get:}
\]

\[
\sin \theta_1 = \frac{90}{150} = \frac{3}{5}, \quad \sin \theta_2 = \frac{120}{150} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

----

### Figures described:

- For Example 5:  
  - A force diagram showing three forces \(F\), \(r\), and 20 kg.wt. acting at a point with angles \(\alpha\) and \(90^\circ\) between them.  
  - A right triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5 representing the trigonometric ratios for \(\alpha\).

- For Example 6:  
  - A triangle \(ABC\) with right angle at \(C\), sides \(90\) cm, \(120\) cm, and \(150\) cm.  
  - Angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) opposite to sides 90 cm and 120 cm respectively.  
  - Two tensions \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) acting along the strings from points \(A\) and \(B\) suspending a weight of 200 gm.wt.



---


# Lesson Four

## Using Lami's rule:

$$
\frac{T_1}{\sin(180^\circ - \theta_1)} = \frac{T_2}{\sin(180^\circ - \theta_2)} = \frac{200}{\sin 90^\circ}
$$

$$
\therefore \frac{T_1}{\sin \theta_1} = \frac{T_2}{\sin \theta_2} = \frac{200}{\sin 90^\circ}
$$

$$
\therefore \frac{T_1}{\frac{3}{5}} = \frac{T_2}{\frac{4}{5}} = \frac{200}{1}
$$

$$
\therefore T_1 = \frac{200}{1} \times \frac{3}{5} = 120 \text{ gm.wt.}, \quad T_2 = \frac{200}{1} \times \frac{4}{5} = 160 \text{ gm.wt.}
$$

----

## Another solution:

By using the triangle of forces rule: Draw \( \overline{DF} \parallel \overline{CB} \), then \(\triangle DFC\) is the triangle of forces.

$$
\therefore \frac{T_1}{CF} = \frac{T_2}{FD} = \frac{200}{DC}
$$

$$
\therefore T_1 = 200 \times \frac{CF}{DC} = 200 \sin \theta_1 = 200 \times \frac{3}{5} = 120 \text{ gm.wt.}
$$

$$
T_2 = 200 \times \frac{FD}{DC} = 200 \sin \theta_2 = 200 \times \frac{4}{5} = 160 \text{ gm.wt.}
$$

----

## Third solution: (By resolution):

- The three forces are in equilibrium.
- The resultant of the two tensions = The third force and in the opposite direction.
- \( \vec{T_1} \) and \( \vec{T_2} \) are the two components of \( \vec{R} \) and they are perpendicular.

$$
\therefore T_1 = R \cos \theta_2 = 200 \times \frac{3}{5} = 120 \text{ gm.wt.}
$$

$$
T_2 = R \sin \theta_2 = 200 \times \frac{4}{5} = 160 \text{ gm.wt.}
$$

----

## Fourth solution: (By perpendicular of forces triangle):

- \(\triangle ABC\) is perpendicular of forces triangle.

$$
\therefore \frac{T_1}{90} = \frac{200}{150} = \frac{T_2}{120}
$$

$$
\therefore T_1 = 120 \text{ gm.wt.}, \quad T_2 = 160 \text{ gm.wt.}
$$

----

## Example 7

A weight of 80 gm.wt. is suspended by a string fixed in a vertical wall. The weight is pulled by a force perpendicular to the string till it becomes in equilibrium when it is inclined on the wall by an angle of measure \(30^\circ\). Find, in case of equilibrium, the magnitude of the force and the tension in the string.

----

### Diagrams description:

- First diagram shows a Y-shaped string with points B, D, A at the top, C at the bottom, and F in the middle. The forces \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) act along the strings BA and BC respectively, with angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\). The weight 200 gm.wt. acts downward at C. Lengths are marked as 150 cm (BA), 120 cm (AC), and 90 cm (BC).

- Second diagram shows the same setup with a right angle marked at R between the two tension forces \(T_1\) and \(T_2\), indicating perpendicular components.



---


# Unit 1

## Solution

Due to Lami's rule we get:  
$$\frac{F}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{T}{\sin 120^\circ} = \frac{80}{\sin 90^\circ}$$

Therefore,  
$$\frac{F}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{T}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = 80$$

$$\therefore F = 80 \times \frac{1}{2} = 40 \text{ gm.wt.}, \quad T = 80 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 40 \sqrt{3} \text{ gm.wt.}$$

### Another solution: (By triangle of forces)

Draw the line of action of **F** to meet the wall at C, then \(\triangle CAB\) is the triangle of forces.  
Due to the triangle of forces rule we get:  
$$\frac{F}{CA} = \frac{T}{AB} = \frac{80}{BC}$$

In \(\triangle CAB\):  
$$CA : AB : BC = 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2$$

Therefore,  
$$\frac{F}{1} = \frac{T}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{80}{2}$$

$$\therefore F = 40 \text{ gm.wt.}, \quad T = 40 \sqrt{3} \text{ gm.wt.}$$

----

## Example 8

A light string **AB** of length 8 cm. Its terminal A is fixed at a point. A weight of 300 gm.wt. is suspended at the other terminal B. Find the magnitude of the needed force to keep the weight in equilibrium at a distance of 4 cm. From the horizontal line passing through A, also find the tension in the string in each of the two cases.  
(1) If the force is horizontal.  
(2) If the direction of the force is perpendicular to **AB**.

### Solution

#### The first case:

If the force is horizontal, we can take \(\triangle ABC\) as the triangle of forces.

$$\therefore \frac{T}{AB} = \frac{F}{AC} = \frac{300}{BC}$$

Calculate \(AC\):  
$$AC = \sqrt{(8)^2 - (4)^2} = 4 \sqrt{3} \text{ cm}$$

Therefore,  
$$\frac{T}{8} = \frac{F}{4 \sqrt{3}} = \frac{300}{4}$$

$$\therefore T = 600 \text{ gm.wt.}, \quad F = 300 \sqrt{3} \text{ gm.wt.}$$

#### The second case:

If the direction of the force is perpendicular to **AB**.

Due to Lami's rule:  
$$\frac{T}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{F}{\sin 120^\circ} = \frac{300}{\sin 90^\circ}$$

Therefore,  
$$T = \frac{300 \sin 150^\circ}{\sin 90^\circ}$$

$$\therefore T = 150 \text{ gm.wt.}, \quad F = \frac{300 \sin 120^\circ}{\sin 90^\circ} = 150 \sqrt{3} \text{ gm.wt.}$$

## Example 9

A body of weight 18 kg.wt. is placed on a smooth plane inclined to the horizontal by an angle of measure 30°. It is pulled upwards under the action of a force (F) inclined with the line of greatest slope of the plane by an angle of measure 30°. Find the magnitude of this force and the reaction of the plane.

### Solution

The body is in equilibrium under the action of the three forces of magnitudes \(F\), \(r\), and 18 kg.wt. where:  
- The measure of the angle between the 1st and 2nd forces is 60°  
- The angle between the 2nd and the 3rd is 150°  
- The angle between the 3rd and the 1st is \(30^\circ + 90^\circ + 30^\circ = 150^\circ\) also.

Applying Lami's rule we get:

$$
\frac{F}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{r}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{18}{\sin 60^\circ}
$$

i.e.,

$$
\frac{F}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{r}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{18}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}
$$

Therefore,

$$
F = r = 18 \times \frac{1}{2} \div \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 6 \sqrt{3} \text{ kg.wt.}
$$

----

### Another solution:

- The line of action of the weight \(\vec{W}\) is the line of action of the resultant of the two forces \(\vec{F}\) and \(r\), and it bisects the angle between them.  
- \(F = r\)  
- \(R = 2F \cos \frac{\alpha}{2}\)  

Therefore,

$$
18 = 2F \cos 30^\circ
$$

$$
18 = 2F \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
$$

$$
F = \frac{18}{\sqrt{3}} = 6 \sqrt{3} \text{ kg.wt.}
$$

Thus,

$$
F = r = 6 \sqrt{3} \text{ kg.wt.}
$$

----

# UNIT 1

## Example 10

A light string is fastened from its terminals at two points B and C such that **BC** is equilibrium horizontal. A small smooth ring of weight 20 gm.wt. slides on the string till the angle between the two branches of the string in equilibrium becomes 90° in measure. Prove that the lengths of the two branches of the string are equal, then find the value of the tension in each of them.

### Solution

- The ring is smooth.
- The values of tension in the two branches of the string are equal.

$$
\text{i.e. Tension in the branch } AB = \text{tension in the branch } AC = T
$$

Using Lami's rule we get:

$$
\frac{T}{\sin \theta_2} = \frac{T}{\sin \theta_1} = \frac{20}{\sin 90^\circ}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\sin \theta_1 = \sin \theta_2
$$

$$
\theta_1 = \theta_2 = \frac{90^\circ}{2} = 45^\circ
$$

$$
T = 10 \sqrt{2}
$$

Since \( AD \perp BC \) and \( \theta_1 = \theta_2 = 45^\circ \),

$$
AB = AC
$$

Therefore, the lengths of the two branches of the string are equal.

----

## Example 11

A body of weight \( W \) newton is suspended by two strings. The first inclines on the vertical by an angle of measure 30° and passes over a fixed smooth pulley and carries at its free end a weight \( 16 \sqrt{3} \) newton. The second string inclines on the vertical by an angle of measure \( \theta \) and passes over another fixed smooth pulley and carries at its terminal a body of weight 16 newton. Find in equilibrium case the value of \( W \) and the value of \( \theta \).

### Solution

Using Lami's rule:

$$
\frac{T_1}{\sin \theta} = \frac{T_2}{\sin 30^\circ} = \frac{W}{\sin(\theta + 30^\circ)}
$$

$$
\frac{16 \sqrt{3}}{\sin \theta} = \frac{16}{\sin 30^\circ} = \frac{W}{\sin(\theta + 30^\circ)}
$$

$$
\sin \theta = \frac{16 \sqrt{3} \sin 30^\circ}{16} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\theta = 60^\circ
$$

$$
\frac{16}{\sin 30^\circ} = \frac{W}{\sin (60^\circ + 30^\circ)}
$$

Therefore,

$$
W = 32 \text{ newton}
$$

# Lesson 5

## Follow: The equilibrium  
(Meeting lines of action of three equilibrium forces)

----

### Rule (4)

If a rigid body is in equilibrium under the action of three coplanar non-parallel forces, then the lines of action of these forces meet at a point.

**For example, in the opposite figure:**

If a uniform rod of weight (W) is in equilibrium on a smooth vertical wall and on rough horizontal ground then:

1. The weight of the rod acts vertically downwards at its midpoint. (centre of gravity)  
2. The reaction of the smooth vertical wall (r₁) which is perpendicular to the wall in direction of **BD**  
3. The reaction of the rough ground (r₂) with unknown direction, and to determine its direction, we draw **AD** passes through the point D (The point of intersection between **W**, **r₁**)

----

### Remarks

1. The weight of the uniform sphere acts at its geometric centre (centre of gravity)  
2. If **AB** is a rod, its end A is attached to a hinge fixed at a vertical wall and the other end B is attached to a string fixed at the point C which lies above A exactly and we notice that:

A metallic sphere of weight 2 kg.wt. and of radius length 30 cm is suspended at a point \(B\) on its surface by a string of length 30 cm. Its other end \(A\) is fixed at a point in a vertical wall to be in equilibrium as it rests on the wall. Find the magnitude of the tension in the string and the magnitude of the reaction of the wall.

### Solution

The sphere is at rest under the action of three forces:

1. The weight of the sphere whose magnitude is 2 kg.wt. acts vertically downwards at its centre \(M\).

2. The reaction of the wall of magnitude \(r\), acts at the point of touch of the sphere with the wall (C) in the direction perpendicular to the wall, hence it passes through the centre of the sphere \(M\).

# Lesson Five

(3) The tension in the string of magnitude \( T \) acts in the direction of \(\overrightarrow{BA}\).

- The lines of action of the weight force and the reaction force meet at \( M \).
- The line of action of the tension force in the string should pass through the point \( M \),  
  *i.e.* \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) passes through the point \( M \), then \(\triangle MAC\) is the triangle of forces where  
  \( MA = MB + BA = 60 \text{ cm} \), \( CM = 30 \text{ cm} \).

- \(\triangle AMC\) is a right-angled triangle of \((30^\circ - 60^\circ)\) angles.

- \[
  AC = 30 \sqrt{3} \text{ cm}

## Example 2

\(\overrightarrow{AB}\) is a uniform rod of length 60 cm, and its weight 24 kg.wt., acting at (D) the midpoint of \(\overrightarrow{AB}\). The end \( A \) of the rod is attached to a hinge fixed at a vertical wall. The other end \( B \) is attached to a light string; its other end is fixed at the point \( C \) on a vertical wall above \( A \) at a distance 80 cm from \( A \). If the rod is in equilibrium horizontally, find the magnitude of the tension in the string and the magnitude and direction of the reaction of the hinge at \( A \).

### Solution

From \(\triangle ABC\):  
\[
BC = \sqrt{(60)^2 + (80)^2} = 100 \text{ cm}
\]

The rod is in equilibrium under the effect of three forces:

1. Its weight 24 kg.wt., acts vertically downwards at the point \( D \) (the midpoint of \(\overrightarrow{AB}\)).

2. The tension in the string (\( T \)) acts in the direction of \(\overrightarrow{BC}\).

3. The reaction of the hinge at \( A \) (its magnitude = \( r \)).

- The two lines of action of the weight and the tension meet at the point \( M \).
- The line of action of the reaction of the hinge passes through the point \( M \) also.
- \( D \) is the midpoint of \(\overrightarrow{AB}\), \( MD \parallel AC \).
- \( M \) is the midpoint of \(\overrightarrow{BC}\).

# Unit 1

∴ AM is a median of ΔABC which is right at A  
∴ AM = \(\frac{1}{2}\) BC = 50 cm.  
∴ ΔAMC is the triangle of forces  
\[
\therefore \frac{T}{MC} = \frac{r}{AM} = \frac{24}{CA}
\]
i.e.  
\[
\frac{T}{50} = \frac{r}{50} = \frac{24}{80}
\]
\[
\therefore r = T = 24 \times \frac{50}{80} = 15 \text{ kg.wt.}
\]

From ΔAMD:  
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{40}{30} = \frac{4}{3}
\]
\[
\therefore \theta \approx 53^\circ 8'
\]

∴ The reaction of the hinge at A inclines to the rod with an angle of measure \(53^\circ 8'\).

## Example 3

**A uniform rod of length 50 cm. and weight 120 gm. wt., is suspended at its two ends freely by two strings, their other two ends are fixed at one point. If the lengths of the two strings are 30 cm. and 40 cm. respectively. Find the magnitude of the tension in each of the two strings.**

### Solution

The rod is in equilibrium under the effect of three forces:  
their magnitudes are \(T_1\), \(T_2\) and 120 gm.wt., where \(\overline{AC}\) is the line of action of \(T_1\) and \(\overline{BC}\) is the line of action of \(T_2\). They are meeting at the point C.

∴ The action line of the weight of the rod should pass through C also.  
\[
(AB)^2 = 2500, \quad (AC)^2 + (CB)^2 = 900 + 1600 = 2500
\]
∴ \(m(\angle ACB) = 90^\circ\)  
∴ D is the midpoint of the hypotenuse \(\overline{AB}\)  
∴ \(DC = DA = DB\)  
∴ \(m(\angle ACD) = m(\angle DAC), \quad m(\angle DCB) = m(\angle DBC)\)

Applying Lami's rule we get:  
\[
\frac{T_1}{\sin(\alpha)} = \frac{T_2}{\sin(\theta)} = \frac{120}{\sin 90^\circ}
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{\frac{30}{50}} = \frac{T_2}{\frac{40}{50}} = 120
\]

\[
\therefore T_1 = 120 \times \frac{30}{50} = 72 \text{ gm.wt.}, \quad T_2 = 120 \times \frac{40}{50} = 96 \text{ gm.wt.}

## Example 4

**\(\overline{AB}\) is a uniform rod of length 140 cm. and weight 480 gm.wt. Its end A is attached to a hinge fixed on a vertical wall. A force \(\vec{F}\) acts horizontally at the other end B to make the rod at rest at a position in which the rod inclines to the horizontal at an angle of measure \(30^\circ\). Find the magnitude of \(\vec{F}\), and the magnitude and the direction of the reaction of the hinge at A.**

- Rod AB length 50 cm in Example 3, with strings AC = 30 cm and BC = 40 cm.  
- Angles and tensions \(T_1\), \(T_2\) marked.  
- Weight 120 gm at midpoint D.]



---


# Lesson Five

## Solution

The rod is at rest under the effect of three forces:

1. Its weight 480 gm.wt. acts vertically downwards at the point D (the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\))
2. The horizontal force \(\vec{F}\) at B
3. The reaction of the hinge at A of magnitude \(r\)

- The lines of action of the forces of weight and the horizontal force are meeting at the point M (*i.e.* in the direction of \(\overline{MA}\))
- The line of action of the reaction of the hinge should pass through the point M also
- \(\triangle CMA\) is the triangle of forces.

$$
\frac{F}{CM} = \frac{r}{MA} = \frac{480}{AC} \quad \therefore \quad m(\angle ABC) = 30^\circ
$$

$$
AC = \frac{1}{2} AB = 70 \text{ cm}, \quad BC = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} AB = 70 \sqrt{3} \text{ cm}
$$

- D is the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\), \(DM \parallel AC\)
- M is the midpoint of \(\overline{BC}\), therefore \(MC = 35 \sqrt{3} \text{ cm}\)

$$
AM = \sqrt{(70)^2 + \left(35 \sqrt{3}\right)^2} = 35 \sqrt{7} \text{ cm}
$$

$$
\therefore \quad \frac{F}{35 \sqrt{3}} = \frac{r}{35 \sqrt{7}} = \frac{480}{70}
$$

$$
F = 240 \sqrt{3} \text{ gm.wt.}, \quad r = 240 \sqrt{7} \text{ gm.wt.}
$$

- \(\triangle AMC\) is right-angled triangle at C

$$
\tan(\angle AMC) = \frac{AC}{MC} = \frac{70}{35 \sqrt{3}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}
$$

$$
m(\angle AMC) \approx 49^\circ 6'
$$

- The reaction of the hinge makes an angle of measure \(49^\circ 6'\) with the horizontal.

----

## Example 5

**A uniform rod rests with its two ends on two smooth planes inclined to the horizontal at two angles of measures \(60^\circ\) and \(30^\circ\). Find the measure of the angle which the rod makes with the horizontal at the equilibrium position and if the weight of the rod equals 24 newton. Determine the magnitudes of the two reactions of the two planes.**

### Solution

The rod is in equilibrium under the action of three forces:

1. The weight 24 newton acts vertically downwards at the point M (the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\))
2. The reaction of the first plane \(r_1\)

[The solution continues on the next page.]

----

### Figures description:

- First figure (top right): A rod \(\overline{AB}\) inclined at \(30^\circ\) with horizontal, with points C and M marked, and forces \(F\) horizontally at B, weight 480 gm.wt. vertically down at D (midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\)), and reaction \(r\) at A.
- Second figure (bottom right): A rod resting on two planes inclined at \(60^\circ\) and \(30^\circ\) to the horizontal, with forces \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) acting perpendicular to the planes, weight 24 N acting vertically down at midpoint M.



---


# UNIT 1

### (3) The reaction of the second plane \( r_2 \)

* The lines of action of the two forces of reactions meet at the point C.
* The line of action of the weight of the rod passes through the same point "C" either.
* If D is the point of meeting the two planes, then \(\angle A\), \(\angle D\) and \(\angle B\) are right-angles.
* The figure ACBD is a rectangle.
* If M is the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\),
* M is the point of intersection of the two diagonals of the rectangle.
* \(\overline{CD}\) is a diagonal in the rectangle passing through M,
* \(\overline{CD}\) is vertical \(\therefore m(\angle CDX) = 90^\circ\)
* \(m(\angle MDA) = 30^\circ\)
* \(MD = MA\)
* \(m(\angle DAM) = 30^\circ\)
* \(m(\angle YAD) = 60^\circ\)
* \(m(\angle YAM) = 30^\circ\)

* The rod makes an angle of measure \(30^\circ\) with the horizontal.

From \(\triangle ADC\): \(m(\angle ACD) = 60^\circ\)

Applying Lami's rule we get:

$$
\frac{r_1}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{r_2}{\sin 120^\circ} = \frac{24}{\sin 90^\circ}
$$

\[
\therefore r_1 = 12 \text{ newton}, \quad r_2 = 12 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}.
\]


---


# Lesson Five

The line of action of the reaction of the ground must pass through the point **E**,  
then \(\triangle DBE\) is the triangle of forces where:

$$
DE = AC = \sqrt{3} \text{ metre}, \quad BD = \frac{1}{2} BC = 1 \text{ metre}
$$

$$
BE = \sqrt{(1)^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2} = 2 \text{ metre}
$$

Applying the triangle of forces rule we get:

$$
\frac{r_1}{DB} = \frac{r_2}{BE} = \frac{8 \sqrt{3}}{ED} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{r_1}{1} = \frac{r_2}{2} = \frac{8 \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}
$$

$$
\therefore r_1 = 8 \text{ kg.wt.}, \quad r_2 = 16 \text{ kg.wt.}
$$

Therefore, the pressure on the wall = 8 kg.wt., the pressure on the ground = 16 kg.wt.

> **Remark**  
> The pressure of the two ends of the ladder on the floor and the wall equals in magnitude the reactions of the floor and the wall on the two ends of the ladder.

----

## Example 7

**AB** is a uniform rod of length 120 cm and weight 15 kg.wt., its end **A** is attached to a hinge fixed at a point on a vertical wall.  
The rod is kept in equilibrium horizontally by attaching it at a point **C** on it where \(AC = 80 \text{ cm}\) by a string. The other end of the string is fixed at a point **D** on the vertical wall above **A** and at a distance \(80 \sqrt{3} \text{ cm}\) from it. Calculate the magnitude of each of the tension in the string and the reaction of the hinge.

### Solution

The rod is kept in equilibrium under the effect of three forces:

1. Its weight 15 kg.wt., acts vertically downwards at  
   \(M\) (the midpoint of **AB**)
2. The tension force in the string (T)
3. The reaction of the hinge (r)

- The lines of action of the weight and the tension are meeting at the point **E**.
- Therefore, the line of action of the reaction of the hinge passes through the point **E** also.
- Therefore, \(\triangle AED\) is the triangle of forces.

$$
CD = \sqrt{(80)^2 + \left(80 \sqrt{3}\right)^2} = 160 \text{ cm}
$$

$$
\triangle CME \sim \triangle CAD : \quad \frac{CM}{CA} = \frac{CE}{CD} = \frac{ME}{AD}
$$

$$
\therefore \frac{20}{80} = \frac{CE}{160} = \frac{ME}{80 \sqrt{3}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad CE = 40 \text{ cm}, \quad ME = 20 \sqrt{3}, \quad ED = 120 \text{ cm}
$$

$$
AE = \sqrt{(60)^2 + \left(20 \sqrt{3}\right)^2} = 40 \sqrt{3} \text{ cm}
$$

----

### Diagram description:

- Triangle \(ADE\) is right-angled at \(A\).
- \(AD = 120 \text{ cm}\) (vertical wall segment).
- \(DE = 80 \sqrt{3} \text{ cm}\) (vertical segment from \(D\) to \(E\)).
- \(CE = 40 \text{ cm}\) (horizontal segment).
- \(ME = 20 \sqrt{3} \text{ cm}\) (horizontal segment).
- \(AB = 120 \text{ cm}\) horizontal rod.
- \(M\) is midpoint of \(AB\), \(AM = 60 \text{ cm}\), \(MB = 60 \text{ cm}\).
- Forces acting: weight 15 kg.wt. at \(M\), tension \(T\) in string at \(E\), reaction \(r\) at hinge \(A\).



---


# Unit 1

Applying the triangle of forces rule:

$$
\frac{r}{40 \sqrt{3}} = \frac{T}{120} = \frac{15}{80 \sqrt{3}}
$$

$$
\therefore r = 7.5 \text{ kg.wt.}
$$

$$
\therefore T = 7.5 \sqrt{3} \text{ kg.wt.}
$$

## Example 8

A string of length 24 cm, is fixed from its ends at two pins A and B in a horizontal line, the distance between them is 12 cm. The string passes inside a smooth ring to be suspended in it, its weight is 144 dyne, then the ring is pulled horizontally by a force **F** till it becomes down B directly.

Find the magnitude of tension in each of the two branches of the string, find also the magnitude of **F**.

### Solution

Supposing that \( BM = l \) cm.

$$
\therefore MA = (24 - l) \text{ cm}
$$

$$
\therefore (24 - l)^2 = l^2 + (12)^2
$$

$$
\therefore l = 9 \text{ cm}
$$

$$
\text{Let } m(\angle MAB) = \theta
$$

$$
\therefore \cos \theta = \frac{4}{5}, \quad \sin \theta = \frac{3}{5}
$$

- The ring is smooth.
- The tension in the two branches \(\overline{MB}\) and \(\overline{MA}\) are equal in magnitude.
- The ring is in equilibrium under the effect of four forces which are:

$$
(F, 0^\circ), \quad (T, 90^\circ), \quad (T, 180^\circ - \theta), \quad (144, 270^\circ)
$$

$$
\therefore X = 0
$$

$$
\therefore F \cos 0^\circ + T \cos 90^\circ + T \cos (180^\circ - \theta) + 144 \cos 270^\circ = 0
$$

$$
F \times 1 + T \times 0 + T \times (-\cos \theta) + 144 \times 0 = 0
$$

$$
F - \frac{4}{5} T = 0 \quad (1)
$$

$$
\therefore Y = 0
$$

$$
F \sin 0^\circ + T \sin 90^\circ + T \sin (180^\circ - \theta) + 144 \times \sin 270^\circ = 0
$$

$$
F \times 0 + T \times 1 + T \sin \theta + 144 \times (-1) = 0
$$

$$
T + \frac{3}{5} T - 144 = 0
$$

$$
T \left(1 + \frac{3}{5}\right) = 144
$$

$$
\therefore T = 90 \text{ dyne}
$$

Substituting in (1):

$$
\therefore F = \frac{4}{5} \times 90 = 72 \text{ dyne}
$$

> The ring is in equilibrium under the effect of four forces, so it will be solved by using the method you studied in lesson 3

### Diagram description:

- A horizontal line segment AB of length 12 cm.
- A string of length 24 cm passes through a smooth ring at point M.
- The ring is pulled horizontally by force **F** to the right.
- The weight of the ring is 144 dyne acting vertically downward.

# Lesson Five

## Another solution:

- The weight and the vertical tension on the same straight line.
- Their resultant can be calculated as \( (144 - T) \).

Using Lami's rule:

$$
\frac{F}{\sin(90^\circ + \theta)} = \frac{T}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{144 - T}{\sin(180^\circ - \theta)}
$$

$$
\frac{F}{\cos \theta} = \frac{T}{1} = \frac{144 - T}{\sin \theta}
$$

$$
\frac{F}{\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)} = T = \frac{144 - T}{\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)}
$$

$$
\frac{3}{5} T = 144 - T
$$

$$
\frac{8}{5} T = 144
$$

$$
T = 90 \text{ dyne}, \quad F = 90 \times \frac{4}{5} = 72 \text{ dyne}
$$

----

## Third solution:

- The weight and the vertical tension on the same straight line.
- Their resultant can be calculated as \( (144 - T) \) and the \(\triangle ABM\) becomes the triangle of forces.

$$
\frac{144 - T}{9} = \frac{T}{15} = \frac{F}{12}
$$

$$
3T = 720 - 5T
$$

$$
T = 90 \text{ dyne}
$$

$$
F = 72 \text{ dyne}
$$

and

$$
\frac{144 - T}{3} = \frac{T}{5}
$$

$$
8T = 720
$$

$$
\frac{90}{15} = \frac{F}{12}
$$

# Lesson 1  
## The straight lines and the planes in the space

### Geometrical concepts and axioms

#### 1) The straight line:
Is an infinite set of points, and we can determine it exactly if we know any two different points on it.

*For example:*  
**In the opposite figure:**  
The two points "A, B" passing through one and only one straight line which is \(\overleftrightarrow{AB}\) while the two points "C, D" passing through another straight line which is \(\overleftrightarrow{CD}\).

> *i.e.* The straight line is determined by two different points on it.

**Remark**  
\[
\overrightarrow{AB} \subset \overleftrightarrow{AB} \subset \overleftrightarrow{AB}
\]

#### 2) The plane:
Is an infinite set of points representing a surface with no ends where any straight line passing through two points on it lies completely on that surface and we denote it by capital letters as \(X, Y\) or .......... and we can denote it using at least three non-collinear points on the plane as: \(ABC\).

> *i.e.* The plane is determined by three distinct non-collinear points.

# UNIT 2

## Remarks

1. The geometrical shapes as the triangle, the square, the circle and ... is an infinite set of points and these shapes are called planed geometrical shapes because each of them is a subset of its plane.

2. Where the plane extends into infinity in all directions, we can represent it using a planed geometrical shape on it as a square or a circle or a parallelogram or ...

### 3. The space:

Is an infinite set of points, it contains all the geometric figures and planes, surfaces and solids while the solids as the sphere and the cylinder and the cube, ... etc. are a set of infinite points but we can’t contain it in one plane, but we can contain it in the space and the faces of these solids formed from some planed parts as the cube or non-planed as the sphere.

## Remarks

* Any point in the space passing through it an infinite number of the straight lines.
* Any point in the space passing through it an infinite number of the planes.
* Any two points in the space passing through them one and only one straight line.
* Any two points in the space passing through them an infinite number of the planes.

----

## Determination of the plane in the space

**The plane is determined in each of the following cases:**

### 1. Three distinct non-collinear points:

**In the opposite figure:**

The points A, B, C are non-collinear so that we can determine the plane (X) or ABC from that we can deduce:

There is one and only one plane which passes through three non-collinear points.

# Unit 2

### (3)  
If two straight lines are parallel to a third in the space, then they all are parallel.  
i.e. If \( L_1 \parallel L_3 \), \( L_2 \parallel L_3 \), then \( L_1 \parallel L_2 \).

```
Diagram:
Three parallel lines L1, L2, L3 with arrows indicating parallelism.
```

### (4)  
All vertical straight lines in the space are parallel but not all horizontal straight lines in the space are parallel.

```
Diagram 1:  
A cuboid with vertical lines L1, L2, L3, L4 all parallel (vertical arrows).  
Label: Horizontal surface.

Diagram 2:  
A parallelogram with horizontal lines L1, L2, L3 which are not parallel (arrows showing different directions).  
Label: Horizontal surface.
```

- All the vertical straight lines \( L_1, L_2, L_3 \) and \( L_4 \) are parallel.  
- The horizontal straight lines \( L_1, L_2 \) and \( L_3 \) are not parallel.

### (5)

```
Diagram 1:  
Quadrilateral ABCD with diagonals intersecting at M.

A skew quadrilateral ABCD with diagonals not intersecting.
```

- The sides of the quadrilateral ABCD lie in one plane, because

# Lesson 2  
## The pyramid

### The definition of the pyramid

Is a solid has one base as a polygon and all its other faces are triangles with a common vertex and the pyramid is called a triangular, quadrilateral, pentagonal or ........ according to the number of sides of the polygon of its base.

**For example:**

<table>

### By using the opposite figure: we can explain some concepts of the pyramid:

* MABCD is a quadrilateral pyramid.  
  Its lateral faces are the triangles MAB, MBC, MCD, MAD, and its base is a polygon ABCD.

* The lateral faces of the pyramid: are always triangles but the base could be a triangle or a quadrilateral or a pentagon or ........

* The vertex of the pyramid: Is the common point for all lateral faces of the pyramid.  
  In the figure: The point "M" is the vertex of the pyramid MABCD.

# Lesson Two

* **The lateral edge of the pyramid**:  
  Is a line segment joining between the vertex of the pyramid and any vertex of its base vertices, as \( \overline{MA}, \overline{MB}, \overline{MC}, \overline{MD} \), as in the figure.

* **The height of the pyramid**:  
  Is the distance between the vertex of the pyramid and its base surface.  
  *i.e.* Is the length of the perpendicular from the vertex of the pyramid to its base surface.  
  (\( \overline{MN} \) is the height of the pyramid as in the figure)

* **The slant height of the pyramid**:  
  Is the distance between the vertex of the pyramid and one of its base sides.  
  *i.e.* Is the length of the perpendicular line segment from the vertex to one of the base sides of the pyramid.  
  (\( \overline{MX} \) is a slant height of the pyramid MABCD where \( \overline{MX} \perp \overline{AB} \))

> ### Remarks
> * The perpendicular straight line to a plane is perpendicular to any straight line in that plane, then the perpendicular straight line to the base of the pyramid is perpendicular to any straight line in it.
> * The regular polygon is a polygon in which its sides are equal in length and its angles are equal in measure.
> * The geometrical centre of any regular polygon is the centre of inscribed circle or the circumcircle for it.
> * The geometrical centre of the parallelogram and its special cases is the point of intersection of the diagonals.
> * The geometrical centre of the triangle is the point of intersection of its medians.

## Special cases of the pyramid

### 1) The right pyramid:

The pyramid is right if the position of perpendicular from the vertex of the pyramid to the base is passing through its geometrical centre.

**For example:**  
* In the pyramid MABCD as in the figure: If N is the geometrical centre of the base ABCD and \( \overline{MN} \perp \) the plane of the base ABCD, then the pyramid MABCD is called a right pyramid.

# 2 The regular pyramid :

Is the pyramid in which its base is a regular polygon whose centre is the position of the perpendicular from the vertex of the pyramid to the base.  
*i.e.* A right pyramid of a base as a regular polygon.

## For example :

In the pyramid MABCD as in the figure:  
if N is the geometrical centre of the regular base ABCD "square" and MN ⟂ the plane of the base,  
then the pyramid MABCD is a regular pyramid.

## Properties of the regular pyramid :

1. Its lateral edges are equal in length.  
2. Its slant heights are equal in length.  
3. Its lateral faces are congruent isosceles triangles.

## Remarks

* Every regular pyramid is a right pyramid but not vice versa.  
* Not necessary that the lateral edges of the right pyramid are equal in length.  
* Not necessary that the slant heights of the right pyramid are equal in length.  
* The regular triangular pyramid is called a triangular pyramid of regular faces if its all faces are equilateral triangles and any one of them is its base.

## Example 1

**MABCD is a regular quadrilateral pyramid, the length of its base side is 12 cm, and its height length equals 8 cm. Find the length of its slant height.**

### Solution

Let X be a midpoint of \( \overline{AB} \)  
∴ MABCD is a regular quadrilateral pyramid  
∴ MA = MB  
∴ \( \overline{MX} \perp \overline{AB} \)  
∴ \( \overline{MX} \) is the slant height of the pyramid  

In \( \triangle ABC \): X is a midpoint of \( \overline{AB} \), N is a midpoint of \( \overline{AC} \)  
∴ \( XN = \frac{1}{2} BC \)  
∴ \( XN = 6 \text{ cm} \)  
∴ \( MN \perp \) The plane ABCD  
∴ \( MN \perp XN \)  
∴ \( \triangle MXN \) is right at N  

\[
(XM)^2 = (XN)^2 + (MN)^2
\]

\[
(XM)^2 = 36 + 64 = 100
\]

∴ \( XM = 10 \text{ cm} \)

### Figures description:

- Second figure: Pyramid MABCD with base side 12 cm, height 8 cm, X midpoint of AB, N midpoint of AC, showing right triangle MXN with right angle at N, and slant height XM = 10 cm.

# Example 2

**MABC** is a regular triangular pyramid with base \(\triangle ABC\), the length of its base length is 6 cm, and the length of its height is 4 cm. Find the length of its edge and its slant height.

## Solution

Let \(X\) be the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\).

- \(\therefore\) MABC is a regular triangular pyramid.
- \(\therefore \triangle ABC\) is an equilateral triangle.
- \(\therefore X\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\) and \(\overline{CX} \perp \overline{AB}\).
- \(\therefore \triangle BXC\) is a right-angled triangle at \(X\).

\[
(XC)^2 = (BC)^2 - (BX)^2 = 36 - 9 = 27
\]

\[
XC = \sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3} \text{ cm}
\]

- \(\therefore N\) is the centre of \(\triangle ABC\).
- \(\therefore N\) is the point of intersection of the medians of \(\triangle ABC\).
- \(\therefore NX : NC = 1 : 2\).

\[
NX = \sqrt{3} \text{ cm}, \quad NC = 2\sqrt{3} \text{ cm}
\]

- \(\overline{MN} \perp\) The plane \(ABC\).
- \(\therefore \overline{MN} \perp \overline{XC}\).
- \(\triangle MNC\) is a right-angled triangle at \(N\).

\[
(MC)^2 = (MN)^2 + (NC)^2 = 16 + 12 = 28
\]

\[
MC = \sqrt{28} = 2\sqrt{7} \text{ cm}
\]

- \(\therefore\) The length of the edge of the pyramid \(= 2\sqrt{7} \text{ cm}\).
- \(\triangle MNC\) is a right-angled triangle at \(N\).

\[
(MX)^2 = (MN)^2 + (NX)^2 = 16 + 3 = 19
\]

\[
MX = \sqrt{19} \text{ cm}
\]

- \(\therefore X\) is a midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\) and \(\overline{MX} \perp \overline{AB}\).
- \(\therefore \overline{MX}\) is the slant height of the pyramid \(= \sqrt{19} \text{ cm}\).

----

### Enrich your knowledge

**Euler relation:** For any solid in which its base is a polygon, then:

$$
\text{Number of its faces} + \text{number of its vertices} = \text{number of its edges} + 2
$$

**For example: In the pentagonal pyramid:**  
- number of its faces = 6 faces  
- number of its vertices = 6 vertices  
- number of its edges = 10 edges  

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{i.e. Number of its faces} + \text{number of its vertices} = 6 + 6 = 12 \\
&\text{number of its edges} + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12 \\
&\therefore \text{Number of faces} + \text{number of vertices} = \text{number of edges} + 2
\end{aligned}
$$

# Lesson Two

## Example 3

The opposite net represents a net of a regular quadrilateral pyramid. Find:

1. Height of the pyramid.
2. The slant height of the pyramid.

### Solution

The net is representing a regular quadrilateral pyramid. Its base ABCD is a square, its vertex M, and its height \( \overline{MN} \), where N is the point of intersection of the diagonals of the base.

- \( ABCD \) is a square.
- The length of its diagonal = its side length \( \times \sqrt{2} \).
- \( AC = 20 \times \sqrt{2} = 20\sqrt{2} \, \text{cm} \).
- \( AN = 10 \sqrt{2} \, \text{cm} \).
- MABCD is a right quadrilateral pyramid.
- \( \overline{MN} \perp \) The plane of the base ABCD.
- \( \overline{MN} \perp \overline{AN} \).
- \( \triangle ANM \) in which \( m(\angle ANM) = 90^\circ \).

\[
(MN)^2 = (AM)^2 - (AN)^2 = (26)^2 - \left(10 \sqrt{2}\right)^2 = 476
\]

\[
MN = \sqrt{476} = 2 \sqrt{119} \, \text{cm}
\]

- The height of the pyramid = \( 2 \sqrt{119} \, \text{cm} \).

Let X be the midpoint of \( \overline{AB} \).

- \( AX = 10 \, \text{cm} \).
- \( MA = MB \).
- \( \overline{MX} \perp \overline{AB} \).
- \( \triangle AXM \) in which \( m(\angle AXM) = 90^\circ \).

\[
(MX)^2 = (AM)^2 - (AX)^2 = (26)^2 - (10)^2 = 576
\]

\[
MX = \sqrt{576} = 24 \, \text{cm}
\]

- The slant height of the pyramid = 24 cm.

### The lateral area of regular pyramid - the total area of pyramid - the volume of pyramid:

* The lateral area of the pyramid = the sum of areas of the lateral faces.
* The lateral area of the regular pyramid = \( \frac{1}{2} \) base perimeter \( \times \) slant height.
* The total surface area of the pyramid = lateral area + area of the base.
* The volume of the pyramid = \( \frac{1}{3} \) base area \( \times \) height.



---


# Unit 2

## Finding the lateral area of regular pyramid

If the side length of the base in regular pyramid is \( L \) and the number of its base sides is \( n \) and its lateral height \( \hat{h} \), then from the net of this pyramid we find it has \( n \) congruent faces each one is an isosceles triangle and the area of each triangle =  
$$ \frac{1}{2} \times L \times \hat{h} $$

∴ The lateral area of the regular pyramid  
$$ = \frac{1}{2} \times L \times \hat{h} \times n $$

, ∵ perimeter of the base = \( n \times L \)

∴ The lateral area of the regular pyramid  
$$ = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base perimeter} \times \text{slant height} $$

----

## Finding the volume of the pyramid

### Experiment activity

* Bring a hollow vessel in the shape of a right prism, and another one in the shape of a right pyramid where their bases are congruent and they have the same height as in the opposite figure.
* Fill the pyramid vessel with **grains** of rice or sand then put it in the prism.
* Repeat this process three times and you will note that:  
  The prism will be filled completely with the **grains** and that means:

Volume of the pyramid =  
$$ \frac{1}{3} \text{ volume of the prism has the same base and height} $$

∴ The volume of the prism = the base area × height

∴  
$$ \text{Volume of the pyramid} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times \text{height} $$

----

## Remarks

1. In the triangular pyramid of regular faces:  
   double the square of its edge length = 3 times the square of its height.

$$ 2L^2 = 3h^2 $$

Where \( L \) = edge length, \( h \) = the height

# Lesson Two

(2) The total surface area to the triangular pyramid of regular faces =  
$$L^2 \sqrt{3}$$  
where L is the length of edge.

(3) The volume of the triangular pyramid of regular faces =  
$$\frac{\sqrt{2}}{12} L^3$$  
where L is the edge length.

----

## Example 4

A regular quadrilateral pyramid the length of its base diagonal is  
$$60 \sqrt{2} \text{ cm}$$  
and its slant height is 50 cm. Find:

1. The height of the pyramid.  
2. L.S.A and T.S.A of the pyramid.  
3. Volume of the pyramid.

----

## Solution

* Let MABCD be a regular quadrilateral pyramid, the diagonals of its base intersected at N.

* The length of the base side =  
$$\frac{60 \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 60 \text{ cm}.$$

* E is the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\).

1. The quadrilateral pyramid is regular.  
   - Its base has a square shape.  
   - \( \overline{MN} \perp \) the plane ABCD  
   - \( \overline{MN} \perp \overline{EN} \)  
   - \(\triangle MEN\) is right angled at N.  
   - E is the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\), N is the midpoint of \(\overline{AC}\).  
   - \( EN = \frac{1}{2} BC = 30 \text{ cm} \).  
   - Height \( h = \sqrt{50^2 - 30^2} = 40 \text{ cm} \).

2. The L.S.A of the pyramid =  
$$\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base perimeter} \times \text{slant height}$$  
$$= \frac{1}{2} \times (60 \times 4) \times 50 = 6000 \text{ cm}^2.$$

* The area of the base =  
$$60 \times 60 = 3600 \text{ cm}^2.$$

* The T.S.A of the pyramid = L.S.A + base area =  
$$6000 + 3600 = 9600 \text{ cm}^2.$$

3. Volume of the pyramid =  
$$\frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3600 \times 40 = 48000 \text{ cm}^3.$$

# UNIT 2

## Example 5

Use the opposite net to describe the formed solid, then find its total surface area and its volume.

----

### Solution

The net represents a regular quadrilateral pyramid, its base as a square of side length = 30 cm, and the length of its lateral edge = 39 cm.

Let the pyramid be MABCD, N is the point of intersection of the diagonals of the base, E is the midpoint of AB.

The lateral face MAB is an isosceles triangle.  
Therefore, **ME** is the slant height.

AE = 15 cm.

In triangle AEM, which is right-angled at E:

$$
ME = \sqrt{(MA)^2 - (AE)^2} = \sqrt{39^2 - 15^2} = 36 \text{ cm}
$$

MN is perpendicular to the plane ABCD,  
therefore,  
$$
MN \perp EN
$$

EN = \(\frac{1}{2}\) BC = 15 cm.

In triangle MEN, which is right-angled at N:

$$
MN = \sqrt{(ME)^2 - (EN)^2} = \sqrt{36^2 - 15^2} = 3 \sqrt{119} \text{ cm}
$$

The lateral surface area (L.S.A.) of the pyramid is:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base perimeter} \times \text{slant height} = \frac{1}{2} \times (30 \times 4) \times 36 = 2160 \text{ cm}^2
$$

Area of the base:

$$
30 \times 30 = 900 \text{ cm}^2
$$

The total surface area (T.S.A.) of the pyramid is:

$$
\text{L.S.A.} + \text{base area} = 2160 + 900 = 3060 \text{ cm}^2
$$

The volume of the pyramid is:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{3} \times 900 \times 3 \sqrt{119} = 900 \sqrt{119} \text{ cm}^3
$$

----

### Figures description:

- The net diagram shows a square base of side 30 cm with four congruent triangular faces each having a lateral edge of 39 cm.
- The 3D pyramid diagram shows the apex M above the square base ABCD, with N as the intersection of diagonals, and E as the midpoint of AB. The slant height ME and height MN are indicated.



---


# Lesson Two

## Example 6

MABCD is a regular quadrilateral pyramid, its total surface area = \(360 \, \text{cm}^2\) and its slant height = 13 cm. Find the length of its base edge, then find its volume.

### Solution

Let the edge length of the squared base = \(X\) cm.

- The T.S.A of the pyramid = \(360 \, \text{cm}^2\).
- The base area + L.S.A = 360
- \(X \times X + \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times X \times 13 = 360\)
- \(X^2 + 26X - 360 = 0\)
- \((X + 36)(X - 10) = 0\)
- \(X = -36\) (refused) or \(X = 10\)

\(\therefore\) The edge length of the pyramid base = 10 cm.

- \(EN = \frac{1}{2} BC = 5 \, \text{cm}\).
- \(MN = \sqrt{13^2 - 5^2} = 12 \, \text{cm}\).

\(\therefore\) Volume of the pyramid = \(\frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{3} \times (10)^2 \times 12 = 400 \, \text{cm}^3\).

----

## Example 7

A regular quadrilateral pyramid of volume \(48 \, \text{cm}^3\) and the length of its base edge = 6 cm, find its total surface area.

### Solution

Let MABCD be a regular quadrilateral pyramid.

- N is the intersection point of its base diagonal.
- E is the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\).
- Volume of the pyramid = \(48 \, \text{cm}^3\).

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 48
\]

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 6 \times 6 \times h = 48
\]

\(\therefore h = 4 \, \text{cm}\).

- The height of the pyramid = \(MN = 4 \, \text{cm}\).

# Unit 2

## Example 8

**MABC** is a triangular pyramid of regular faces, the length of each edge of its edges equals \(8 \sqrt{3}\) cm. Find:

1. The slant height of the pyramid.
2. Height of the pyramid.
3. T.S.A of the pyramid.
4. Volume of the pyramid.

### Solution

- The triangular pyramid is of regular faces.
- Each face is an equilateral triangle.
- The slant height of the pyramid

$$
= MD = AD = 8 \sqrt{3} \sin 60^\circ = 12 \text{ cm}.
$$

- \(E\) is the point of intersection of the medians of \(\triangle ABC\)

$$
AE = \frac{2}{3} AD = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ cm}.
$$

- \(ME \perp\) the plane \(ABC\)

$$
ME \perp AD
$$

- \(\triangle MAE\) is right-angled at \(E\)

$$
ME = \sqrt{(8 \sqrt{3})^2 - 8^2} = 8 \sqrt{2} \text{ cm}.
$$

- The height of the pyramid = \(8 \sqrt{2}\) cm.

- L.S.A. of the pyramid

$$
= \frac{1}{2} \text{ base perimeter} \times \text{slant height}
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{2} \times (3 \times 8 \sqrt{3}) \times 12 = 144 \sqrt{3} \text{ cm}^2.
$$

- Area of the base

$$
= \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \sqrt{3} \times 8 \sqrt{3} \sin 60^\circ = 48 \sqrt{3} \text{ cm}^2.
$$

- T.S.A. of the pyramid

$$
= 144 \sqrt{3} + 48 \sqrt{3} = 192 \sqrt{3} \text{ cm}^2.
$$

- Volume of the pyramid

$$
= \frac{1}{3} \text{ base area} \times \text{height}
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{3} \times 48 \sqrt{3} \times 8 \sqrt{2} = 128 \sqrt{6} \text{ cm}^3.
$$

----

### Notice that

- The triangular pyramid is of regular faces.
- \(2L^2 = 3h^2\)
- \(2 \times (8 \sqrt{3})^2 = 3 h^2\)
- \(h = 8 \sqrt{2}\)
- Height of the pyramid = \(8 \sqrt{2}\) cm.

----

## Example 9

A regular hexagonal pyramid in which the sum of areas of its lateral faces is seven times its base area.

Prove that: The volume of the pyramid = \(8 r^3\)

Where \(r\) is the radius of the inscribed circle of the base.


---


# Lesson Two

## Solution

Let the edge length of the base of the pyramid = \( L \) cm,  
height of the pyramid = \( h \), and its slant height = \(\hat{h}\).

- The sum of areas of its lateral faces = \( 7 \times \) base area  
- \(\frac{1}{2} \times \) base perimeter \(\times\) slant height = \( 7 \times \) base area  
- \(\frac{1}{2} \times 6L \times \hat{h} = 7 \times \frac{1}{2} \times L \times r \times 6\)  
- \(3L \hat{h} = 21 L r\)  
- \(\therefore \hat{h} = 7r\)

- \(MN \perp\) the plane ABCDEF  
- \(\therefore MN \perp NY\)  
- \(\triangle MNY\) is right-angled at \(N\)  
- \[
h = \sqrt{\hat{h}^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{(7r)^2 - r^2} = 4 \sqrt{3} r
\]

- Volume of the pyramid = \(\frac{1}{3} \times\) base area \(\times\) height  
\[
= \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} \times L \times r \times 6 \times 4 \sqrt{3} r = 4 \sqrt{3} L r^2
\]

- \(r = L \sin 60^\circ\)  
- \[
L = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} r
\]

- Volume of the pyramid =  
\[
4 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} r \times r^2 = 8 r^3
\]

----

## Example 10

MABC is a triangular pyramid. Its vertex \(M\) is at distance \(4 \sqrt{5}\) cm from the base ABC where  
\(AB = 7\) cm, \(BC = 8\) cm, \(AC = 9\) cm. Find the volume of the pyramid.

### Solution

- The perimeter of \(\triangle ABC = 7 + 8 + 9 = 24\) cm.  
- Half the perimeter = 12 cm.  
- The area of \(\triangle ABC\)  
\[
= \sqrt{12(12-7)(12-8)(12-9)} = 12 \sqrt{5} \text{ cm}^2
\]

> **Remember that**  
> The area of \(\triangle ABC = \sqrt{S(S-AB)(S-BC)(S-AC)}\)  
> where \(S\) is half the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\).

- The volume of the pyramid = \(\frac{1}{3} \times\) base area \(\times\) height  
\[
= \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \sqrt{5} \times 4 \sqrt{5} = 80 \text{ cm}^3
\]

# Lesson 3  
## The cone

----

### The definition of the cone  
Is a solid has only one base as a closed curve and one vertex, and its lateral surface formed from line segments drawn from its vertex to its curved base and each of them is called drawer of the cone.

----

### In the opposite figure:  
\(\triangle ABC\) is right angled triangle at \(B\), if it is rotated about the axis \(\overline{AB}\) with a full turn, the formed solid is called right circular cone, and the point \(A\) is called vertex of the cone, \(\overline{AC}\) is the drawer of the cone, \(\overline{AB}\) is axis of the cone, surface of circle \(B\) is the base of the cone.

# Lesson Three

## Properties of the right circular cone:

1. The axis of the right circular cone is perpendicular to the plane of the base.  
   i.e. \(\overline{AB} \perp\) the plane of circle B

2. The height of the right circular cone is the length of the line segment joining between the vertex of the cone and the centre of its base and its length is always less than the length of the drawer of the cone.  
   If the length of \(\overline{AB} = h\) length unit, the length of \(\overline{AC} = L\) length unit.  
   Then the height of the cone \((h) = \sqrt{L^2 - r^2}\), then: \(h < L\)

> **Remark**  
> The right circular cone can be formed by the rotation of an isosceles triangle about its axis of symmetry by a half turn.  
> **In the opposite figure:**  
> If \(\triangle ABC\) is isosceles in which \(AB = AC\), \(\overline{AD}\) is the axis of symmetry of \(\triangle ABC\) and the triangle \(ABC\) is rotated about \(\overline{AD}\) by a half turn, then the formed solid is a right circular cone. Its base is the circle \(D\), and its drawer is \(\overline{AB}\) or \(\overline{AC}\), its height is \(\overline{AD}\) and its vertex is the point \(A\).

## Example 1

A right circular cone, the length of its drawer is 25 cm and its height is 24 cm.  
Find the perimeter and the area of the base of the cone. \(\left(\pi = \frac{22}{7}\right)\)

### Solution

- \(\overline{AB} \perp\) the plane of circle B  
- \(\overline{AB} \perp \overline{BC}\)  
- \(m(\angle ABC) = 90^\circ\)  
- \(BC = 7 \text{ cm}\)  
- \((BC)^2 = (AC)^2 - (AB)^2 = (25)^2 - (24)^2 = 49\)  
- \(r\) (the radius of the base) = 7 cm  
- The perimeter of the base = \(2 \pi r = 2 \times \frac{22}{7} \times 7 = 44 \text{ cm}\)  
- The area of the base = \(\pi r^2 = \frac{22}{7} \times 49 = 154 \text{ cm}^2\)

----

### Diagrams described:

- A right circular cone with vertex \(A\), base circle \(B C\), height \(h\) from \(A\) perpendicular to base at \(B\), radius \(r\) from \(B\) to \(C\), and slant height \(L\) from \(A\) to \(C\).
- An isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with axis of symmetry \(\overline{AD}\), rotated about \(\overline{AD}\) to form the cone with base circle \(D\).
- The example cone with drawer length 25 cm, height 24 cm, and radius 7 cm.

# Unit 2

## The right cone net:

- From the net of the right cone we note that:

  1. \( AB = AC = L \), where \( L \) is the length of drawer of the cone.
  
  2. The circular sector \( ABC \) represents the lateral surface of the cone and the length of \( BC = \) perimeter of the circle \( N = 2 \pi r \).
  
  3. Surface of the circle \( N \) represents the base of the cone.

----

### Remember

One of the right circular cylinder nets:

- A rectangle with height \( h \) and width \( x \).
- Two circles of radius \( r \) above and below the rectangle.

----

### Remember that

The circular sector is a part of the surface of a circle bounded by two radii and an arc of the circle.

* Area of the circular sector:
  
  $$
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} L r
  $$
  
  (where \( L \) is the length of the arc of the sector)

* Area of the circular sector:
  
  $$
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \theta^{\text{rad}} r^2
  $$
  
  (where \( \theta^{\text{rad}} \) is the radian measure of the sector angle)

* Area of the circular sector:
  
  $$
  \text{Area} = \frac{x^\circ}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2 = \frac{x^\circ}{360^\circ} \times \text{area of the circle}
  $$
  
  (where \( x^\circ \) is degree measure of the sector angle)

* Perimeter of the sector:
  
  $$
  = 2r + L \quad \text{length unit}
  $$

----

### Diagrams described:

- The right cone net shows a circular sector \( ABC \) with radius \( L \) and a circle \( N \) with radius \( r \).
- The right cone is shown with height \( L \) and base radius \( r \).
- The right circular cylinder net shows a rectangle with height \( h \) and width \( x \), and two circles of radius \( r \) above and below the rectangle.
- A circular sector diagram shows angle \( \theta \) between two radii \( r \) and arc length \( L \).
- A triangle diagram relates \( L \), \( r \), and \( \theta^{\text{rad}} \).

# Lesson Three

## Important remarks

1. If \( L > 2r \), then the cone net as shown, \( 0^\circ < \theta < 180^\circ \)

   - Diagram: A cone with height \( M \) and slant height \( L \) is shown.
   - The cone net is shown as a sector with radius \( L \) and central angle \( \theta \), with a circle of radius \( r \) below it.
   - The sector has two equal sides \( L \) and the angle \( \theta \) at the apex.
   - The circle radius is \( r \).

2. If \( L = 2r \), then the cone net as shown, \( \theta = 180^\circ \)

   - Diagram: A cone with height \( M \) and slant height \( L \) is shown.
   - The cone net is shown as a semicircle (half circle) with radius \( L \) and central angle \( \theta = 180^\circ \), with a circle of radius \( r \) below it.
   - The semicircle has two equal sides \( L \) and the angle \( \theta = 180^\circ \) at the apex.
   - The circle radius is \( r \).

3. If \( L < 2r \), then the cone net as shown, \( 180^\circ < \theta < 360^\circ \)

   - Diagram: A cone with height \( M \) and slant height \( L \) is shown.
   - The cone net is shown as a sector with radius \( L \) and central angle \( \theta \), with a circle of radius \( r \) below it.
   - The sector has two equal sides \( L \) and the angle \( \theta \) at the apex.
   - The circle radius is \( r \).

----

## Example 2

### In the opposite figure:

A piece of paper as a circular sector, the area of its surface = \( 25 \pi \, \text{cm}^2 \), and the measure of its central angle equals \( 90^\circ \) folded to touch \( \overline{MA} \) and \( \overline{MB} \) and formed a cone. Find the height of the cone to nearest tenth.

### Solution

- Area of the sector = \( \frac{1}{2} \theta^{\text{rad}} r^2 \)
- Given: \( \frac{1}{2} \theta^{\text{rad}} r^2 = 25 \pi \)
- Since \( \theta = 90^\circ = \frac{\pi}{2} \) radians, substitute:
  
  $$
  \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{\pi}{2} \times r^2 = 25 \pi
  $$

- Simplify:

  $$
  \frac{\pi}{4} r^2 = 25 \pi
  $$

- Divide both sides by \( \pi \):

  $$
  \frac{r^2}{4} = 25
  $$

- Multiply both sides by 4:

  $$
  r^2 = 100
  $$

- Therefore:

  $$
  r = 10 \text{ cm}
  $$

- Area of the sector can also be expressed as:

  $$
  \frac{1}{2} L r = 25 \pi
  $$

- Substitute \( r = 10 \):

  $$
  \frac{1}{2} \times L \times 10 = 25 \pi
  $$

- Simplify:

  $$
  5L = 25 \pi
  $$

- Therefore:

  $$
  L = 5 \pi \text{ cm}
  $$

- Also:

  $$
  r^2 = 100
  $$

- So:

  $$
  MA = 10 \text{ cm}
  $$

### Diagrams:

- Circular sector \( \angle AMB = 90^\circ \) with points \( A \), \( B \), and apex \( M \).
- Cone formed by folding the sector, with base radius \( r = 10 \) cm, slant height \( L = 5 \pi \) cm, and height \( MN \) perpendicular to base \( AB \).



---


# Unit 2

$$\therefore \text{ The length of } \overline{AB} = 5 \pi \text{ cm.}$$  
$$\therefore \text{ The circumference of the circle } N = 5 \pi \text{ cm.}$$  
$$\therefore 2 \pi r_N = 5 \pi \quad \therefore r_N = 2.5 \text{ cm.}$$  
$$\therefore \triangle ANM \text{ in which } m(\angle ANM) = 90^\circ, \quad NA = 2.5 \text{ cm.}$$  
$$MA = 10 \text{ cm.}$$  
$$\therefore MN = \sqrt{(MA)^2 - (NA)^2} = \sqrt{(10)^2 - (2.5)^2} \simeq 9.7 \text{ cm.}$$  
$$\therefore \text{ Height of the cone } = 9.7 \text{ cm.}$$  

----

## The lateral area - total area - volume of a right cone:

**If** \(r\) **is the radius of the cone base,** \(L\) **is the cone drawer,** \(h\) **is the height, then:**

* The lateral surface area (L.S.A.) of the right cone = \(\pi L r\)  
* The total surface area (T.S.A.) of the right cone = \(\pi r (L + r)\)  
* Volume of the right cone = \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\)  

----

## Finding the lateral surface area and total surface area of the right cone

[Diagram of a cone and its net showing the sector ABC and circle with radius \(r\)]

From the net of the right cone, we deduce that:  
The lateral surface area of the right cone = the area of sector \(ABC\)

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \times \text{length of } BC \times AB
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \times \text{perimeter of the cone base} \times AB
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \pi r \times L
\]

\[
= \pi L r
\]

$$\therefore \text{ The lateral surface area of the right cone } = \pi L r$$

Also,  
The total surface area of the right cone = the lateral surface area + the base area

\[
= \pi L r + \pi r^2
\]

$$\therefore \text{ The total surface area of the right cone } = \pi r (L + r)$$

# Lesson Three

## Finding the volume of the right cone

### Experiment activity
* Bring a hollow vessel as a right circular cylinder and another one as a right circular cone where their bases are congruent and they have the same height as in the opposite figure.

* Fill the cone vessel with grains of rice or sand then empty it into the cylinder vessel.

* Repeat this process three times and you will note that: the cylinder will be filled completely with the grains and that means:

> The volume of the cone = \(\frac{1}{3}\) volume of the cylinder has the same base and height

* The volume of the cylinder = base area \(\times\) height

Therefore,

> The volume of the right cone = \(\frac{1}{3}\) base area \(\times\) height  
> \(= \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\)

----

## Example 3

A right circular cone, the length of its base diameter is 12 cm, and its height is 8 cm. Find:

1. The L.S.A. (Lateral Surface Area)  
2. The T.S.A. (Total Surface Area)  
3. The volume

### Solution

- \(AM \perp\) the circle plane  
- \(AM \perp MB\)  
- \(\triangle MAB\) is right-angled at \(M\)  
- \(r = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ cm}\)  
- \(AB = \sqrt{8^2 + 6^2} = 10 \text{ cm}\)  
- \(L = 10 \text{ cm}\)

- The lateral surface area (L.S.A.) = \(\pi r L = \pi \times 6 \times 10 = 60 \pi \text{ cm}^2\)  
- Area of the base = \(\pi r^2 = 36 \pi \text{ cm}^2\)  
- The total surface area (T.S.A.) = \(60 \pi + 36 \pi = 96 \pi \text{ cm}^2\)  
- Volume of the cone = \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times 36 \times 8 = 96 \pi \text{ cm}^3\)

# UNIT 2

## Example 4

Use the opposite net to describe the formed solid and if the length of the arc \( \overset{\frown}{CC} = 30 \pi \) cm.  
Find the volume of this solid and its total surface area.

### Solution

The net represents a right cone.

- The length of \( \overset{\frown}{CC} = 30 \pi \)  
- \( 2 \pi r = 30 \pi \)  
- \( \therefore r = 15 \text{ cm} \).

- \( \triangle ABM \) is right-angled at \( M \).  
- \( h = \sqrt{25^2 - 15^2} = 20 \text{ cm} \).

- The volume = \( \frac{1}{3} \) base area \(\times\) height  
  \( = \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times (15)^2 \times 20 = 1500 \pi \text{ cm}^3 \).

- The total surface area = \( \pi r (L + r) = \pi \times 15 \times (15 + 25) \)  
  \( = 600 \pi \text{ cm}^2 \).

Find the length of the radius of its base.  
\[
\left( \pi \approx \frac{22}{7} \right)
\]

### Solution

- The capacity of the flask = 6.16 litres.  
- Volume of the right cone = \( 6.16 \times 1000 \text{ cm}^3 \).  
- \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{22}{7} \times r^2 \times 30 = 6160 \).  
- \( \therefore r = 14 \text{ cm} \).

A pure gold alloy as a right cone of radius length 3 cm and lateral surface area = \(15 \pi \, \text{cm}^2\). Find the gold density if the mass of the alloy = 727 gm.  
\(\pi = 3.14\)

### Solution

- The L.S.A. of the cone = \(15 \pi\)  
- \(\pi L r = 15 \pi\)  
- \(\pi \times L \times 3 = 15 \pi\)  
- \(L = 5 \, \text{cm}\)  
- \(\triangle ABM\) is right-angled at M  
- \(h = AM = \sqrt{5^2 - 3^2} = 4 \, \text{cm}\)  
- Volume of the cone = \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\)  
  \[
  = \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times 3^2 \times 4 = 12 \pi = 37.68 \, \text{cm}^3
  \]
- The density = \(\frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}} = \frac{727}{37.68} \approx 19.3 \, \text{gm/cm}^3\)

----

## Example 7

A regular octagonal pyramid of silver, its base side length is 6 cm and its height 30 cm, melted and converted into a circular right cone whose length of its base radius is 9 cm. If 10% of the silver was missed through the melting process, find the height of the cone to nearest one decimal place.

### Solution

- The area of the regular octagon = \(\frac{8}{4} x^2 \cot \frac{\pi}{8}\)  
  \[
  = 2 \times (6)^2 \cot 22^\circ \approx 173.82 \, \text{cm}^2
  \]
- Volume of the pyramid = \(\frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times \text{height}\)  
  \[
  = \frac{1}{3} \times 173.82 \times 30 = 1738.2 \, \text{cm}^3
  \]
- Volume of the silver in the cone  
  \[
  = \frac{90}{100} \times 1738.2 \approx 1564.4 \, \text{cm}^3
  \]
- \(\frac{1}{3} \pi \times (9)^2 \times h = 1564.4\)  
- \(h \approx 18.4 \, \text{cm}\)

# Unit 2

## Example 8

\(\triangle ABC\) is right-angled at \(A\), \(AB = 15 \, m\), \(AC = 20 \, m\). If the triangle is rotated a complete rotation around \(\overline{BC}\), describe the formed solid, then find the cost of painting this solid with a material resistant to erosion, if the cost of one square metre = 10 pounds and find the volume of this solid.  
\[
\pi = \frac{22}{7}
\]

### Solution

The solid will be two right cones with the same base.

From the figure:

\[
\triangle ABC \text{ is right angled at } A, \quad AD \perp BC
\]

\[
BC = \sqrt{(15)^2 + (20)^2} = 25 \text{ metres}
\]

\[
AD = \frac{15 \times 20}{25} = 12 \text{ metres}
\]

\[
BD = \sqrt{(15)^2 - (12)^2} = 9 \text{ metres}
\]

\[
CD = 25 - 9 = 16 \text{ metres}
\]

**According to the first cone whose vertex is \(B\):**

\[
L = 15 \, m, \quad r = 12 \, m, \quad h = 9 \, m
\]

\[
\therefore \text{The L.S.A.} = \pi L r = \pi \times 15 \times 12 = 180 \pi \, m^2
\]

\[
\text{the volume} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = \frac{1}{3} \pi \times (12)^2 \times 9 = 432 \pi \, m^3
\]

**According to the second cone whose vertex is \(C\):**

\[
L = 20 \, m, \quad r = 12 \, m, \quad h = 16 \, m
\]

\[
\therefore \text{The L.S.A.} = \pi L r = \pi \times 20 \times 12 = 240 \pi \, m^2
\]

\[
\text{the volume} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = \frac{1}{3} \pi \times (12)^2 \times 16 = 768 \pi \, m^3
\]

\[
\therefore \text{The total painting area} = \text{the sum of the lateral surface areas of the two cones}
\]

\[
= 180 \pi + 240 \pi = 420 \pi = 420 \times \frac{22}{7} = 1320 \, m^2
\]

\[
\therefore \text{The cost of the painting} = 1320 \times 10 = 13200 \, \text{L.E.}
\]

\[
\text{Volume of the solid} = \text{sum of volumes of the two cones} = 432 \pi + 768 \pi = 1200 \pi
\]

\[
= 1200 \times \frac{22}{7} = 3771 \frac{3}{7} \, m^3
\]

# Lesson 4  
## The circle

----

### Definition of the circle

> It is the set of points of the plane which are at a constant distance from a fixed point in the same plane.

* The fixed point is called "the centre of the circle". (M)  
* The constant distance is called "the radius length of the circle". (r)  
* The circle is usually denoted by (C)  

, where  
$$ C = \{ A : MA = r, r > 0 \} $$

----

### First  
#### Equation of the circle (In terms of its centre coordinates and radius length)

If \( A = (x, y) \) is a point on the circle whose centre is \( M(d, e) \),  
and the length of its radius = \( r \), in the perpendicular Cartesian coordinates using "the distance between two points" rule we find:

$$ \sqrt{(x - d)^2 + (y - e)^2} = r $$

i.e.  
$$ (x - d)^2 + (y - e)^2 = r^2 $$

"Equation of the circle"


---


# UNIT 2

## Remarks

1. If the centre of the circle is the origin point \((0, 0)\), then the equation of the circle is:

$$
x^2 + y^2 = r^2
$$

2. The position of the point \((x_1, y_1)\) in respect to the circle

\[
C : (x - d)^2 + (y - e)^2 = r^2
\]

* If \((x_1 - d)^2 + (y_1 - e)^2 = r^2\), then the point lies **on** the circle.

* If \((x_1 - d)^2 + (y_1 - e)^2 > r^2\), then the point lies **outside** the circle.

* If \((x_1 - d)^2 + (y_1 - e)^2 < r^2\), then the point lies **inside** the circle.

3. Two circles are congruent if the lengths of their radii are equal.

**For example:**  
If the circle equation of \(C_1\) is:  
$$
x^2 + y^2 = 49
$$  
the circle equation of \(C_2\) is  
$$
(x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 49
$$  
then \(r_1 = r_2 = \sqrt{49} = 7\) length units, then the two circles are congruent, and the circle \(C_2\) is the image of the circle \(C_1\) by translation \((3, 4)\).

Where the image of point \((x, y)\) by translation \((a, b)\) is:  
\[
(x + a, y + b)
\]

----

## Second: The general form of the circle equation

The general form of the circle equation is:

$$
x^2 + y^2 + 2Lx + 2Ky + C = 0
$$

Where the centre \((M) = (-L, -K) = \left(-\frac{1}{2} \text{ coefficient of } x, -\frac{1}{2} \text{ coefficient of } y \right)\),

$$
r = \sqrt{L^2 + K^2 - C}, \quad L^2 + K^2 - C > 0
$$

**For example:**  
The circle whose equation is:  
$$
x^2 + y^2 + 8x - 4y - 16 = 0
$$  
its centre = \(\left(-\frac{1}{2} \text{ coefficient of } x, -\frac{1}{2} \text{ coefficient of } y\right) = (-4, 2)\),

$$
r = \sqrt{L^2 + K^2 - C} = \sqrt{16 + 4 - (-16)} = 6 \text{ length units}.
$$


---


# Lesson Four

## We can deduce the general form of the circle equation as follows:

We know that: The circle whose centre \((d, e)\), the length of its radius = \(r\) is:

$$(x - d)^2 + (y - e)^2 = r^2$$

i.e.

$$x^2 + y^2 - 2dx - 2ey + d^2 + e^2 - r^2 = 0$$

Let \(M(D, K) = (-L, -K)\)

$$\therefore x^2 + y^2 + 2Lx + 2Ky + L^2 + K^2 - r^2 = 0$$

$$\therefore L^2 + K^2 - r^2 = C \quad \text{(constant)}$$

\(\therefore\) The general form of the circle equation is:

$$x^2 + y^2 + 2Lx + 2Ky + C = 0$$

----

### Remarks

1. The general form of the circle equation \(x^2 + y^2 + 2Lx + 2Ky + C = 0\) is:
   * An equation of 2nd degree in \(x, y\)
   * Free of the term \(xy\), *i.e.* Coefficient of \(xy = 0\)
   * Coefficient of \(x^2 =\) coefficient of \(y^2 = 1\)

2. To be the equation of the 2nd degree in \(x, y\) representing a circle, it must satisfy the three conditions in the previous remark and

   $$L^2 + K^2 - C > 0$$

3. To identify the centre or the radius length of a circle using the general form, the coefficient of \(x^2 =\) the coefficient of \(y^2 = 1\), so we need to divide by this coefficient if it is not equal to 1.

----

## Special cases

1. **Equation of the circle passing through the origin point:**

   $$
   x^2 + y^2 + 2Lx + 2Ky = 0
   $$

   The equation is free of the absolute term *i.e.* \((C = 0)\)

2. **Equation of the circle whose centre lies on X-axis:**

   $$
   x^2 + y^2 + 2Lx + C = 0
   $$

   The equation is free of the term containing \(y\), *i.e.* \((K = 0)\)

3. **Equation of the circle whose centre lies on y-axis:**

   $$
   x^2 + y^2 + 2Ky + C = 0
   $$

   The equation is free of the term containing \(x\), *i.e.* \((L = 0)\)


---


# Unit 2

## 4. Equation of the circle touching X-axis:

If the circle whose centre \((-L, -K)\) touches X-axis then:  
the point of tangency A is: \((-L, 0)\) and \(r = |K|\)  
\[
\therefore C = L^2 + K^2 - r^2 = L^2 + K^2 - K^2 = L^2
\]  
Then the equation of the circle becomes:  
$$
x^2 + y^2 + 2Lx + 2Ky + L^2 = 0
$$

----

## 5. Equation of the circle touching y-axis:

If the circle whose centre \((-L, -K)\) touches y-axis, then the point of tangency B is \((0, -K)\) and \(r = |L|\)  
\[
\therefore C = L^2 + K^2 - r^2 = L^2 + K^2 - L^2 = K^2
\]  
Then the equation of the circle becomes:  
$$
x^2 + y^2 + 2Lx + 2Ky + K^2 = 0
$$

----

## 6. Equation of the circle touching the two coordinates:

If the circle whose centre is \((-L, -K)\) touches the two coordinate axes then \(r = |L| = |K|\)  
\[
\therefore C = L^2 + K^2 - r^2 = r^2 + r^2 - r^2 = r^2
\]  
\[
\therefore C = L^2 = K^2 = r^2
\]  
and the equation of the circle becomes:  
$$
x^2 + y^2 + 2Lx + 2Ky + C = 0
$$  
where \(|L| = |K| = r\), \(C = L^2 = K^2 = r^2\)

> 1. The position of a straight line with respect to a circle (D) whose centre (M) and let \(\overline{MC} \perp L\) and intersects it at C  
> * If \(MC < r\), then L is a secant to the circle at two points.  
> * If \(MC = r\), then L is a tangent to the circle.

----

## Example 1

**Find the general form of the equation of the circle whose centre is \((-2, 3)\) and its radius length is 5 length units.**

### Solution

The equation of the circle is:

$$(x + 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 5^2$$

After simplifying:

$$x^2 + y^2 + 4x - 6y - 12 = 0 \quad \text{"After simplify"}$$

**Another solution:**

\[
\begin{aligned}
L &= 2, \quad K = -3, \\
C &= L^2 + K^2 - r^2 = (2)^2 + (-3)^2 - (5)^2 = -12
\end{aligned}
\]

Therefore, the general form of the equation of the circle is:

$$x^2 + y^2 + 4x - 6y - 12 = 0$$

*"The same form we obtained before"*

# UNIT 2

## Example 2

Find the equation of the circle whose centre is the origin point and its diameter length = \(6\sqrt{2}\) length unit, then prove that the circle passing through the point \(\left(\sqrt{2}, -4\right)\).

### Solution

The equation of the circle is:  
$$x^2 + y^2 = \left(3\sqrt{2}\right)^2$$  
then  
$$x^2 + y^2 = 18$$  

By substituting the point \(\left(\sqrt{2}, -4\right)\),  
$$\text{L.H.S.} = \left(\sqrt{2}\right)^2 + (-4)^2 = 18 = \text{R.H.S.}$$  

Therefore, the point \(\left(\sqrt{2}, -4\right)\) lies on the circle.

----

## Example 3

Find the equation of the circle whose centre \(M = (3, -2)\) and passing through the point \(A = (-1, 1)\).

### Solution

$$r = MA = \sqrt{(3 + 1)^2 + (-2 - 1)^2} = 5 \text{ length unit}.$$

Therefore, the equation of the circle is:  
$$(x - 3)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 25$$

----

## Example 4

Find the equation of the circle whose diameter \(\overline{AB}\) where \(A = (4, -1)\), \(B = (-2, 1)\).

### Solution

The centre of the circle \(M\) is the midpoint of \(AB\),  
$$M = \left(\frac{4 + (-2)}{2}, \frac{-1 + 1}{2}\right) = (1, 0)$$  

Radius:  
$$r = MA = \sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (-1 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{10} \text{ length unit}.$$

Therefore, the equation of the circle is:  
$$(x - 1)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = \left(\sqrt{10}\right)^2$$  
then:  
$$(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 10$$

----

## Example 5

3. \(7x^2 + 7y^2 + 42x - 14y + 28 = 0\)


---


# Lesson Four

## Solution

1.  
$$x^2 + y^2 - 2x + 4y - 4 = 0$$  
\[
\therefore L = -1, \quad K = 2, \quad C = -4
\]  
\[
\therefore \text{The centre} = (-L, -K) = (1, -2)
\]  
\[
r = \sqrt{L^2 + K^2 - C} = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + (2)^2 - (-4)} = 3 \text{ length unit}
\]

2.  
$$x^2 + y^2 - 4y - 9 = 0$$  
\[
\therefore L = 0, \quad K = -2, \quad C = -9
\]  
\[
\therefore \text{The centre} = (-L, -K) = (0, 2)
\]  
\[
r = \sqrt{L^2 + K^2 - C} = \sqrt{(0)^2 + (-2)^2 - (-9)} = \sqrt{13} \text{ length unit}
\]

3. By dividing by 7 to make the coefficient of \(x^2\) = the coefficient of \(y^2 = 1\)  
\[
\therefore \text{The equation will be: } x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 2y + 4 = 0
\]  
\[
\therefore L = 3, \quad K = -1, \quad C = 4
\]  
\[
\therefore \text{The centre} = (-L, -K) = (-3, 1)
\]  
\[
r = \sqrt{L^2 + K^2 - C} = \sqrt{(3)^2 + (-1)^2 - 4} = \sqrt{6} \text{ length unit}
\]

----

## Example 6

**Find the equation of the circle whose centre (3, -4) and touches X-axis**

### Solution

\[
L = -3, \quad K = 4
\]  
Since the circle touches x-axis,  
\[
r = |K|, \quad C = L^2
\]  
\[
r = 4 \text{ length unit}, \quad C = 9
\]  
We can find \(C\) using the relation:  
\[
C = L^2 + K^2 - r^2
\]  
Equation of the circle is:  
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 8y + 9 = 0
\]

----

## Example 7

**Find the equation of the circle whose the length of its radius is 5 units and touches y-axis at the point (0, 3)**

### Solution

- The circle touches y-axis at the point \((0, 3)\)  
- The centre = \((-L, 3)\), \(r = |L|\) length unit.  
  i.e. \(|L| = 5\)  
- \[
L = \pm 5, \quad C = K^2 = 9
\]  
- There are two circles, one of them has a centre \((-5, 3)\) and its equation:  
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 10x - 6y + 9 = 0
\]  
- The other has a centre \((5, 3)\) and its equation:  
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 10x - 6y + 9 = 0
\]

5. \( x^2 + y^2 - 16x + 12y + 100 = 0 \)  
6. \( x^2 + 6x - 8y - 7 = 0 \)  

### Solution

# Lesson Four

(4)  
The coefficient of \( x^2 \) = The coefficient of \( y^2 \) and the equation is free of a term containing \( xy \).  
∴ The equation may represent a circle.  
Multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\) to make the coefficient of \( x^2 \) = the coefficient of \( y^2 = 1 \)  
∴  
$$
x^2 + y^2 - 3x + 2y + \frac{9}{2} = 0
$$  
∴ \( 2L = -3 \), \( 2k = 2 \)  
∴  
$$
L = \frac{-3}{2}, \quad k = 1, \quad c = \frac{9}{2}
$$  
∴  
$$
L^2 + K^2 - C = \frac{9}{4} + 1 - \frac{9}{2} = \frac{-5}{4} < 0
$$  
∴ The equation doesn't represent a circle.

∴  
$$
L = -8, \quad k = 6, \quad c = 100
$$  
∴  
$$
L^2 + K^2 - C = 64 + 36 - 100 = 0

## Example 10

**Find the equation of the circle whose radius length = 3 units, and the two equations of the straight lines carrying two diameters are**  
$$
x + y = 2, \quad 2x - y = 7
$$

### Solution

The centre of the circle is the point of intersection of the two straight lines:  
$$
x + y = 2 \quad (1), \quad 2x - y = 7 \quad (2)
$$  
By adding:  
$$
3x = 9 \implies x = 3
$$  
By substitution:  
$$
y = -1
$$  
∴ The centre is the point \((3, -1)\)  
∴  
$$
L = -3, \quad K = 1, \quad C = L^2 + K^2 - r^2 = 9 + 1 - 9 = 1
$$  
∴ Equation of the circle is:

- By substituting the points A, B, and C in the L.H.S. of the equation:  
  - $(-1 + 2)^2 + (3 - 7)^2 = 17 < r^2$  
    - Point A (-1, 3) lies inside the circle.  
  - $(0 + 2)^2 + (-5 - 7)^2 = 148 > r^2$  
    - Point B (0, -5) lies outside the circle.

#### Solution

- For circle \(C_1\):  
  $$(x - 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 4$$  
  - The centre \(M_1 = (3, 2)\), radius \(r_1 = \sqrt{4} = 2\) length unit.

- For circle \(C_2\):  
  $$x^2 + y^2 + 2x + 2y + 1 = 0$$  
  - The centre \(M_2 = (-1, -1)\), radius \(r_2 = \sqrt{1 + 1 - 1} = 1\) length unit.

- Sum of radii:  
  $$r_1 + r_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ length unit}$$

- Distance between centres:  
  $$M_1 M_2 = \sqrt{(3 + 1)^2 + (2 + 1)^2} = 5 \text{ length unit}$$

- Since  
  $$M_1 M_2 > r_1 + r_2$$  
  - The two circles are distant.

  An equilateral triangle \(ABC\) inscribed in a circle with center \(M\). The radius \(r\) is shown from \(M\) to each vertex \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). The angle \(\angle BMC = 120^\circ\).

# Unit 2

$$
= 3 \times \frac{1}{2} \text{MB} \times \text{MC} \times \sin(\angle BMC)
$$

$$
= \frac{3}{2} r^2 \sin 120^\circ
$$

$$
= \frac{3}{2} \times 25 \sin 60^\circ = \frac{3}{2} \times 25 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{75 \sqrt{3}}{4} \quad \text{square unit}.
$$

* Each length unit in the plane represents 4 cm.

* The square unit represents \(4^2 = 16 \text{ cm}^2\).

$$
\therefore \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{75 \sqrt{3}}{4} \times 16 = 300 \sqrt{3} \text{ cm}^2.
$$

----

### Remark

If the number of sides of a regular polygon = \(n\) sides, the length of the radius to the circle passing through its vertices = \(r\), then

$$
\boxed{
\text{Area of the regular polygon} = \frac{n}{2} r^2 \sin \left(\frac{360^\circ}{n}\right)
}
$$

----

### For example:

The regular hexagon polygon whose drawn inside a circle of radius length 8 cm, its area equals:

$$
\frac{6}{2} \times (8)^2 \times \sin \left(\frac{360^\circ}{6}\right)
= 3 \times 64 \times \sin 60^\circ
$$

$$
= 3 \times 64 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 96 \sqrt{3} \quad \text{square unit}.
$$

----

### Example 16

**Find the Cartesian equation of the circle passing through the points**  
\(A = (6, 3), B = (2, 3)\) and \(C = (4, 1)\), then determine its centre and length of its radius.

#### Solution

Let the equation be:

$$
x^2 + y^2 + 2Lx + 2Ky + C = 0
$$

* The points \(A, B\) and \(C\) lie on the circle.

From point \(A\):

$$
36 + 9 + 12L + 6K + C = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 12L + 6K + C = -45 \quad (1)
$$

From point \(B\):

$$
4 + 9 + 4L + 6K + C = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4L + 6K + C = -13 \quad (2)
$$

From point \(C\):

$$
16 + 1 + 8L + 2K + C = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8L + 2K + C = -17 \quad (3)
$$

By subtracting (2) from (1):

$$
8L = -32 \quad \Rightarrow \quad L = -4
$$


---


# Lesson Four

and by subtracting (3) from (1)

$$
\therefore 4L + 4K = -28 \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \therefore L + K = -7
$$

$$
\therefore -4 + K = -7 \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \therefore K = -3
$$

by substitute in (3)

$$
\therefore -32 - 6 + c = -17 \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \therefore C = 21
$$

$$
\therefore \text{The equation is} : x^2 + y^2 - 8x - 6y + 21 = 0
$$

where the centre = (4, 3)

$$
r = \sqrt{16 + 9 - 21} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \text{ length unit.}
$$

----

## Example 17

**Find the equation of the circle whose touches X-axis and passing through the points (-1, 2), (-3, 4)**

### Solution

$$
\therefore \text{The circle touches X-axis} \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \therefore r = |K|, \quad C = L^2
$$

Let the equation of the circle be:

$$
x^2 + y^2 + 2Lx + 2Ky + L^2 = 0
$$

The circle passing through the point (-1, 2) then:

$$
1 + 4 - 2L + 4K + L^2 = 0 \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \therefore L^2 - 2L + 4K = -5 \quad \quad (1)
$$

The circle passing through the point (-3, 4) then:

$$
9 + 16 - 6L + 8K + L^2 = 0 \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \therefore L^2 - 6L + 8K = -25 \quad \quad (2)
$$

By multiplying the equation (1) by 2 then subtracting from the equation (2):

$$
\therefore L^2 - 2L = -15
$$

$$
\therefore L^2 + 2L - 15 = 0
$$

$$
(L - 3)(L + 5) = 0
$$

$$
\therefore L = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad L = -5
$$

$$
\therefore K = -2 \quad \text{or} \quad K = -10
$$

There are two circles; in one of them, 

$$
L = 3, \quad K = -2
$$

and its equation is:

$$
x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 4y + 9 = 0
$$

and in the other circle:

$$
L = -5, \quad K = -10
$$

and its equation is:

$$
x^2 + y^2 - 10x - 20y + 25 = 0
$$

2.  
   1)  
   * The two components are perpendicular  
   * $$F_1 = 18 \cos 60^\circ = 9 \text{ newton}$$  
   * $$F_2 = 18 \sin 60^\circ = 9 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}$$  

   2)  
   Consider \(\overrightarrow{OX}\) is the direction of the first force.  
   \[
   X = 1 \times \cos 0^\circ + 2 \cos 60^\circ + \sqrt{3} \cos 90^\circ \\
   = 1 \times 1 + 2 \times \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{3} \times 0 = 2 \\
   Y = 1 \times \sin 0^\circ + 2 \times \sin 60^\circ + \sqrt{3} \sin 90^\circ \\
   = 1 \times 0 + 2 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \sqrt{3} \times 1 = 2 \sqrt{3} \\
   \therefore \overrightarrow{R} = 2 \hat{i} + 2 \sqrt{3} \hat{j}, \quad R = \sqrt{2^2 + (2 \sqrt{3})^2} = 4 \text{ newton}
   \]

   \[
   \tan \theta = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \\
   \therefore X > 0, \quad Y > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta = 60^\circ
   \]

   * The magnitude of \(\overrightarrow{R}\) is 4 newton and its direction is \(\overrightarrow{MB}\).

   \[
   \sin \theta = 0.8, \quad \cos \theta = 0.6
   \]

   \[
   F_1 = \frac{40 \sin (90^\circ - \theta)}{\sin (180^\circ - \theta)} = \frac{40 \cos \theta}{\sin \theta} = \frac{40 \times 0.6}{0.8} = 30 \text{ N}
   \]

   \[
   F_2 = \frac{40 \sin 90^\circ}{\sin (180^\circ - \theta)} = \frac{40 \times 1}{0.8} = 50 \text{ N}
   \]

   (2)  
   \[
   X = 10 \cos 0^\circ + 20 \cos 120^\circ + 30 \cos 240^\circ = 15
   \]

   \[
   Y = 10 \sin 0^\circ + 20 \sin 120^\circ + 30 \sin 240^\circ = -5 \sqrt{3}
   \]

   \[
   \overrightarrow{R} = -15 \hat{i} - 5 \sqrt{3} \hat{j}
   \]

   \[
   R = \sqrt{225 + 75} = 10 \sqrt{3} \text{ N}
   \]

   \[
   \tan \theta = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{-5 \sqrt{3}}{-15} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}

   \[
   \therefore x < 0, \quad y < 0

$$3 + 6 + b = 10 \sqrt{2} \sin 135^\circ = 10 \quad \therefore b = 1$$  

(b) Let the angle between the inclined plane and the horizontal be \(\theta\)  

$$\tan \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$$  
$$\therefore \theta = 30^\circ$$  

$$F = r \frac{\sin 150^\circ}{\sin 60^\circ} = \frac{300}{2} \frac{1}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = 100 \sqrt{3} \text{ gm.wt.}$$  

## 3
(a)  
$$(x - 2)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 3^2$$

(b) \(\triangle MAB\) is the triangle of forces where \(AM = 60 \text{ cm}\), \(MB = 30 \text{ cm}\)  

$$AB = \sqrt{(60)^2 - (30)^2} = 30 \sqrt{3}$$  

Applying the triangle of forces rule:  

$$\frac{r}{30} = \frac{T_1}{60} = \frac{10}{30 \sqrt{3}}$$  
$$\therefore r = \frac{10 \sqrt{3}}{3} \text{ gm.wt.}, \quad T = \frac{20 \sqrt{3}}{3} \text{ gm.wt.}$$

$$8\% \text{ of wax had been lost during the melting and transferring}$$  

The volume of the cone = \(92\% \times 27000\)  

$$= 24840 \text{ cm}^3$$  

Volume of the cone = \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\)

$$\frac{T_1}{\sin(90^\circ + \theta_1)} = \frac{T_2}{\sin(90^\circ + \theta_2)} = \frac{150}{\sin 90^\circ}$$  

$$\therefore \frac{T_1}{\cos \theta_1} = \frac{T_2}{\cos \theta_2} = 150$$  

$$\frac{T_1}{\frac{6}{10}} = \frac{T_2}{\frac{8}{10}} = 150$$

$$X = 8 \cos 0^\circ + 6 \sqrt{3} \cos 30^\circ + 5 \cos 60^\circ + 4 \sqrt{3} \cos 90^\circ$$  
$$= 8 \times 1 + 6 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 5 \times \frac{1}{2} + 4 \sqrt{3} \times 0 = \frac{39}{2}$$  

$$Y = 8 \sin 0^\circ + 6 \sqrt{3} \sin 30^\circ + 5 \sin 60^\circ + 4 \sqrt{3} \sin 90^\circ$$  
$$= 8 \times 0 + 6 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{1}{2} + 5 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 4 \sqrt{3} \times 1 = \frac{19 \sqrt{3}}{2}$$  

$$\therefore \vec{R} = \frac{39}{2} \hat{i} + \frac{19 \sqrt{3}}{2} \hat{j}$$  

$$R = \sqrt{\left(\frac{39}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{19 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{651} \text{ newton}$$  

$$\tan \theta = \frac{19 \sqrt{3}}{39} \quad \therefore \theta = 40^\circ 9'$$  

(b) The set of forces are in equilibrium  

- \(r\) passes through the point \(E\)  
- \(D\) is the midpoint of \(AB\), \(DE \parallel AC\)

$$
\Rightarrow \triangle ABC \text{ is right-angled triangle at } C
$$

From lami's rule:

$$
\frac{100}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{T_1}{\sin \theta_1} = \frac{T_2}{\sin \theta_2}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow \sin \theta_1 = \frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{80}{100} = \frac{4}{5}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow \sin \theta_2 = \frac{AC}{AB} = \frac{60}{100} = \frac{3}{5}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow 100 = \frac{T_1}{\frac{4}{5}} = \frac{T_2}{\frac{3}{5}} \quad \Rightarrow T_1 = 100 \times \frac{4}{5} = 80 \text{ gm.wt.}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow T_2 = 100 \times \frac{3}{5} = 60 \text{ gm.wt.}
$$

#### 2

The centre of the circle is the midpoint of \( \overline{AB} \)

$$
= \left(\frac{6+0}{2}, \frac{-4+2}{2}\right) = (3, -1)
$$

The diameter length

$$
= \sqrt{(0-6)^2 + (2+4)^2} = 6 \sqrt{2}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow \text{The radius } r = 3 \sqrt{2}
$$

The equation of the circle is:

$$
(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = \left(3 \sqrt{2}\right)^2
$$

$$
\Rightarrow x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 2y - 8 = 0
$$

### 1

- \(\triangle ABC\) is a right angled triangle at \(\angle C\)
- \((AB)^2 = 60^2 + 80^2\)
- \(\therefore AB = 100 \text{ cm}\)

From lami's rule:

$$
\frac{200}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{T_1}{\sin \theta_1} = \frac{T_2}{\sin \theta_2}
$$

- \(\sin \theta_1 = \frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{80}{100} = \frac{4}{5}\)
- \(\sin \theta_2 = \frac{AC}{AB} = \frac{60}{100} = \frac{3}{5}\)

$$
\frac{200}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{T_1}{\frac{4}{5}} = \frac{T_2}{\frac{3}{5}} \implies T_1 = 200 \times \frac{4}{5} = 160 \text{ gm.wt.}
$$

$$
T_2 = 200 \times \frac{3}{5} = 120 \text{ gm.wt.}
$$

$$
|T_1 - T_2| = |160 - 120| = 40
$$

### 2

$$
\sqrt{(5 - (-7))^2 + (-2 - 3)^2} = 13, \quad r_1 + r_2 = 3
$$

- The distance between the two centres \(> r_1 + r_2\)
- \(\therefore\) The two circles are distant.

### 1

$$ R = \sqrt{(8)^2 + (15)^2} = 17 \text{ kg.wt.} \quad \tan \theta = \frac{15}{8} $$  
$$ \therefore \theta = 61^\circ 55' 39'' $$

### 2

Let the two forces be \( F_1, F_2 \) newton

$$ (50)^2 = F_1^2 + F_2^2 \quad \therefore F_1^2 + F_2^2 = 2500 \quad (1) $$  
$$ \tan \theta = \frac{F_2}{F_1} \quad \therefore \frac{F_2}{F_1} = \tan 30^\circ $$

$$ \therefore \frac{F_2}{F_1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \quad \therefore F_1 = \sqrt{3} F_2 \quad (2) $$  
$$ \therefore F_1^2 = 3 F_2^2 \quad (3) $$

Substituting from (3) in (1):

$$ 3 F_2^2 + F_2^2 = 2500 \quad \therefore 4 F_2^2 = 2500 $$  
$$ \therefore F_2^2 = \frac{2500}{4} = 625 \quad \therefore F_2 = 25 \text{ newton} $$

Substituting in (2):

$$ \therefore F_1 = 25 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton} $$

The magnitudes of the two forces are:  
$$ 25 \sqrt{3}, 25 \text{ newton} $$

### 3

$$ (26)^2 = (30)^2 + (16)^2 + 2 \times 30 \times 16 \cos \alpha $$  
$$ \therefore \cos \alpha = -\frac{1}{2} \quad \therefore \alpha = 120^\circ $$

### 4

$$ \left( 3 \sqrt{7} \right)^2 = (9)^2 + (6)^2 + 2 \times 9 \times 6 \cos \alpha $$  
$$ \therefore \cos \alpha = -\frac{1}{2} \quad \therefore \alpha = 120^\circ $$

$$ \tan \theta = \frac{6 \sin 120^\circ}{9 + 6 \cos 120^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \quad \therefore \theta = 40^\circ 53' 36'' $$

$$ \tan \theta = \frac{18 \sin 120^\circ}{15 + 18 \cos 120^\circ} = \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{2} $$  
$$ \therefore \theta = 68^\circ 56' 54'' $$

### 6

$$ \alpha = 120^\circ, \theta = 30^\circ $$

$$ \tan 30^\circ = \frac{F \sin 120^\circ}{12 + F \cos 120^\circ} $$

$$ \therefore \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{F \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{12 + F \times -\frac{1}{2}} $$

$$ \frac{3}{2} F = 12 - \frac{1}{2} F $$

$$ \therefore F = 6 \text{ kg.wt.} $$

$$ R = \sqrt{(12)^2 + 6^2 + 2 \times 12 \times 6 \cos 120^\circ} $$

$$ \therefore R = 6 \sqrt{3} \text{ kg.wt.} $$

Let \( F_1 \) be the smaller force and \( F_2 \) is the greater force.

- The resultant is perpendicular to \( F_1 \)
- $$ F_1 + 30 \cos \alpha = 0 $$
- $$ \therefore F_1 = 30 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 15 \sqrt{3} \text{ kg.wt.} $$
- $$ R = \sqrt{(15 \sqrt{3})^2 + (30)^2 + 2 \times 15 \sqrt{3} \times 30 \times \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)} = 15 \text{ kg.wt.} $$

## 8

1. $$ R = \sqrt{(5 \sqrt{2})^2 + (5)^2 + 2 \times 5 \sqrt{2} \times 5 \cos 45^\circ} $$
   - $$ \therefore R = 5 \sqrt{5} \text{ newton} $$

   - $$ \theta \approx 18^\circ 26' 6'' $$

2. $$ R = \sqrt{(3)^2 + (3 \sqrt{2})^2 + 2 \times 3 \times 3 \sqrt{2} \times \cos 45^\circ} $$

3. $$ R = \sqrt{(150)^2 + (150)^2 + 2 \times 150 \times 150 \times \cos 120^\circ} $$
   - $$ \therefore R = 150 \text{ newton} $$

### Another solution:

----

## 9

- $$ (4 \sqrt{3})^2 = F^2 + (4)^2 + 2 \times F \times 4 \cos 120^\circ $$
- $$ \therefore F^2 - 4F - 32 = 0 $$

- $$ \therefore F = 8 \text{ newton} $$
- $$ \tan \theta = \frac{4 \sin 120^\circ}{8 + 4 \cos 120^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} $$
- $$ \therefore \theta = 30^\circ $$

----

## 10

- The resultant is perpendicular to the first force.
- $$ \sqrt{3} F + 2 F \cos \alpha = 0 $$
- $$ \therefore \cos \alpha = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} $$
- $$ \therefore \alpha = 150^\circ, \text{ when } F = 15 $$
- $$ R = \sqrt{(15 \sqrt{3})^2 + (30)^2 + 2 \times 15 \sqrt{3} \times 30 \cos 150^\circ} = 15 \text{ newton} $$

----

## 11

- The resultant is perpendicular to the second force.
- $$ R^2 = F_1^2 - F_2^2 $$
- $$ 2 = 8 - F_2^2 $$
- $$ F_2^2 = 6 $$
- $$ \therefore F_2 = \sqrt{6} \text{ newton} $$
- $$ F_2 + F_1 \cos \alpha = 0 $$
- $$ \therefore \cos \alpha = -\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2 \sqrt{2}} = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} $$
- $$ \therefore \alpha = 150^\circ $$

----

## 12

- $$ \tan 30^\circ = \frac{F \sin 120^\circ}{16 + F \cos 120^\circ} $$
- $$ \therefore \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} F}{16 - \frac{1}{2} F} $$
- $$ 16 - \frac{1}{2} F = \frac{3}{2} F $$
- $$ \therefore 2F = 16 $$

----

## 13

----

## 14

1. 
- $$ (3F)^2 = (2F)^2 + (3F)^2 + 2 \times 2F \times 3F \cos \theta $$

- $$ \therefore \cos \theta = -\frac{1}{3} $$
- $$ \therefore \theta \approx 109^\circ 28' 16'' $$

2. 
- The resultant \( = F = 3F - 2F \)
- The measure of the angle between the two forces \( = 180^\circ \)



---


(3) : The resultant = 5 F = 2 F + 3 F  
∴ The measure of the angle between the two forces = zero

(4)  
$$\left(\sqrt{13} F\right)^2 = (2F)^2 + (3F)^2 + 2 \times 2F \times 3F \cos \theta$$  
∴ \(13 F^2 = 13 F^2 + 12 F^2 \cos \theta\)  
∴ \(\cos \theta = \text{zero}\)  
∴ \(\theta = 90^\circ\)

----

### 15  
(1) : The direction of the resultant is perpendicular to the second force  
∴ \(F + 2 \cos 120^\circ = 0\)  
∴ \(F = 1\) newton

(2) :  
$$\tan 45 = \frac{2 \sin 120^\circ}{F + 2 \cos 120^\circ}$$  
∴ \(\sqrt{3} = F - 1\)  
∴ \(F = \left(\sqrt{3} + 1\right)\) newton

----

### 16  
∴ \(R \in [2, 10]\)  
∴ The minimum value of \(R = 2\) newton  
∴ \(F_1 - F_2 = 2\)  (1)  

and the maximum value of \(R = 10\) newton  
∴ \(F_1 + F_2 = 10\)  (2)  

adding (1) and (2) : ∴ \(2 F_1 = 12\)  
∴ \(F_1 = 6\) newton  
∴ \(F_2 = 4\) newton  

∴  
$$R = \sqrt{6^2 + 4^2 + 2 \times 6 \times 4 \cos 120^\circ} = 2 \sqrt{7} \text{ newton}$$

----

### 17  
Let the two forces be \(F\) and \(F + 3\)  
∴ The resultant is perpendicular to the smaller force.  
∴ \(F + (F + 3) \cos \alpha = 0\)  
∴ \(\cos \alpha = \frac{-F}{F + 3}\)  
∴ \(R = 3 \sqrt{3}\)  

∴  
$$27 = F^2 + (F + 3)^2 + 2 \times F \times (F + 3) \times \frac{-F}{F + 3}$$  
∴  
$$27 = F^2 + F^2 + 6F + 9 - 2 F^2$$  
∴ \(F = 3\)  

∴ The two forces are 3 newton and 6 newton  
\(\cos \alpha = \frac{-3}{6} = -\frac{1}{2}\)  
∴ \(\alpha = 120^\circ\)

----

### 18  
Let the two forces be \(F_1\) and \(F_2\)  

* **In the first case:**  
$$10 = F_1^2 + F_2^2 \quad (1)$$  

* **In the second case:**  
$$13 = F_1^2 + F_2^2 + 2 F_1 \times F_2 \times \frac{1}{2}$$  

and from (1):  
$$13 = 10 + F_1 F_2 \quad \therefore F_1 F_2 = 3$$  

∴  
$$F_2 = \frac{3}{F_1}$$  

substituting in (1):  
$$10 = F_1^2 + \frac{9}{F_1^2}$$  
∴  
$$10 F_1^2 = F_1^4 + 9$$  
∴  
$$F_1^4 - 10 F_1^2 + 9 = 0$$  
∴  
$$(F_1^2 - 9)(F_1^2 - 1) = 0$$  
∴  
$$F_1^2 = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad F_1^2 = 1$$  
∴  
$$F_1 = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad F_1 = 1$$  

The two forces are 1 and 3 newton.

----

### 19  
$$R_1 = 2 F \cos \frac{\alpha}{2} = 12$$  
∴  
$$F \cos \frac{\alpha}{2} = 6 \quad (1)$$  

$$R_2 = 2 F \cos \frac{180^\circ - \alpha}{2} = 6$$  

∴  
$$F \sin \frac{\alpha}{2} = 3 \quad (2)$$  

Squaring the two equations and adding them:  
$$F^2 \cos^2 \frac{\alpha}{2} + F^2 \sin^2 \frac{\alpha}{2} = 6^2 + 3^2$$  
∴  
$$F^2 \left(\cos^2 \frac{\alpha}{2} + \sin^2 \frac{\alpha}{2}\right) = 45$$  
∴  
$$F = \sqrt{45} = 3 \sqrt{5} \text{ kg.wt.}$$

----

### 20  
* In the first case:  
$$R^2 = F_1^2 + F_2^2 + 2 F_1 F_2 \cos 120^\circ$$  
∴  
$$R^2 = F_1^2 + F_2^2 - F_1 F_2 \quad (1)$$  

* In the second case:  
The measure of the angle between the two forces = 60°  
∴  
$$3 R^2 = F_1^2 + F_2^2 + F_1 F_2 \quad (2)$$  

Substituting from (1) in (2):  
$$3 (F_1^2 + F_2^2 - F_1 F_2) = F_1^2 + F_2^2 + F_1 F_2$$  
∴  
$$2 F_1^2 + 2 F_2^2 - 4 F_1 F_2 = 0$$  
∴  
$$F_1^2 - 2 F_1 F_2 + F_2^2 = 0$$  
∴  
$$(F_1 - F_2)^2 = 0$$  
∴  
$$F_1 = F_2$$  

- \(R_1\) in the first case makes an angle of measure 60° with \(\vec{F_1}\)  
- \(R_2\) in the second case makes an angle of measure 30° with \(\vec{F_1}\) from the other side.  

∴ The measure of the angle between the two resultants = 90°

# Unit 1

## 21

Given:  
$$ \vec{F_1} = (4, 0^\circ), \quad \vec{F_2} = (F, \alpha), \quad \vec{R} = (10, 60^\circ) $$

$$ \vec{R} = \vec{F_1} + \vec{F_2} $$

Therefore:  
$$ (10 \cos 60^\circ, 10 \sin 60^\circ) = (4 \cos 0^\circ, 4 \sin 0^\circ) + (F \cos \alpha, F \sin \alpha) $$

$$ \left(5, 5 \sqrt{3}\right) = (4, 0) + (F \cos \alpha, F \sin \alpha) $$

From the x-components:  
$$ F \cos \alpha + 4 = 5 \implies F \cos \alpha = 1 \quad (1) $$

From the y-components:  
$$ F \sin \alpha = 5 \sqrt{3} \quad (2) $$

Dividing (2) by (1):  
$$ \tan \alpha = 5 \sqrt{3} $$

Therefore:  
$$ \sin \alpha = \frac{5 \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{76}} $$

From (2):  
$$ F \times \frac{5 \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{76}} = 5 \sqrt{3} $$

Hence:  
$$ F = \sqrt{76} = 2 \sqrt{19} \text{ newton} $$

### Another solution:

Applying cosine rule:  
$$ F^2 = (10)^2 + (4)^2 - 2 \times 4 \times 10 \times \cos 60^\circ = 76 $$

Therefore:  
$$ F = 2 \sqrt{19} \text{ newton} $$

----

## 22

Let:  
$$ F_1 > F_2 $$  
$$ F_1 - F_2 = 15 \implies F_1 = 15 + F_2 \quad (1) $$

Given:  
$$ (35)^2 = F_1^2 + F_2^2 + 2 F_1 F_2 \times \frac{1}{2} $$

Substituting from (1):  
$$ 1225 = 225 + F_2^2 + 30 F_2 + F_2^2 - 15 F_2 - F_2^2 $$

Simplify:  
$$ F_2^2 + 15 F_2 - 1000 = 0 \implies (F_2 + 40)(F_2 - 25) = 0 $$

Therefore:  
$$ F_2 = 25 $$

The two forces are 40 and 25 newton.

----

## 23

Given:  
$$ F_1 + F_2 = 4 \implies F_1 = 4 - F_2 \quad (1) $$

$$ 13 = (F_1)^2 + (F_2)^2 + 2 F_1 F_2 \cos 60^\circ $$

Substituting from (1):  
$$ 13 = (4 - F_2)^2 + F_2^2 + (4 - F_2) \times F_2 $$

Simplify:  
$$ 13 = 16 - 8 F_2 + F_2^2 + F_2^2 + 4 F_2 - F_2^2 $$

$$ F_2^2 - 4 F_2 + 3 = 0 \implies (F_2 - 1)(F_2 - 3) = 0 $$

Therefore:  
$$ F_2 = 1 \text{ or } 3 $$

The two forces are 1 and 3 newton.

----

## 24

Let the two forces be \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \) where \( F_1 < F_2 \).

Given:  
$$ F_1 + F_2 = 40 \implies F_1 = 40 - F_2 \quad (1) $$

The resultant is 20 kg.wt.

$$ 400 = F_1^2 + F_2^2 + 2 F_1 F_2 \cos \alpha \quad (2) $$

The resultant is perpendicular to the smaller force, so:  
$$ F_1 + F_2 \cos \alpha = 0 $$

Therefore:  
$$ \cos \alpha = -\frac{F_1}{F_2} $$

Substituting in (2):  
$$ 400 = F_1^2 + F_2^2 - 2 F_1 F_2 \times \frac{F_1}{F_2} $$

$$ 400 = F_1^2 + F_2^2 - 2 F_1^2 $$

$$ 400 = F_2^2 - F_1^2 $$

Substituting from (1):  
$$ 400 = F_2^2 - (40 - F_2)^2 $$

$$ 400 = F_2^2 - 1600 + 80 F_2 - F_2^2 $$

$$ 2000 = 80 F_2 $$

Therefore:  
$$ F_2 = 25 \text{ kg.wt.} $$

Substituting in (1):  
$$ F_1 = 15 \text{ kg.wt.} $$

Also:  
$$ \cos \alpha = \frac{-15}{25} = -\frac{3}{5} $$

----

## 25

$$ R_1 = 2 F \cos 60^\circ = F $$  
$$ R_2 = 2 (2 F) \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sqrt{3} F $$

Therefore:  
$$ R_2 - R_1 = 11 $$

$$ 2 \sqrt{3} F - F = 11 $$

$$ F = \frac{11}{2 \sqrt{3} - 1} $$

$$ F = 1 + 2 \sqrt{3} $$

----

## 26

### First case:

$$ \left(\sqrt{5} F (m+1)\right)^2 = F^2 + (2F)^2 + 2 \times F \times 2F \cos \alpha $$

$$ 5 F^2 (m^2 + 2m + 1) - 5 F^2 = 4 F^2 \cos \alpha $$

$$ 5 F^2 m (m + 2) = 4 F^2 \cos \alpha \quad (1) $$

### Second case:

$$ \left[\sqrt{5} F (m - 1)\right]^2 = F^2 + (2F)^2 + 2 \times F \times 2F \cos (90^\circ - \alpha) $$

$$ 5 F^2 (m^2 - 2m + 1) - 5 F^2 = 4 F^2 \sin \alpha $$

$$ 5 F^2 m (m - 2) = 4 F^2 \sin \alpha \quad (2) $$

Dividing (2) by (1):  
$$ \frac{5 F^2 m (m - 2)}{5 F^2 m (m + 2)} = \frac{4 F^2 \sin \alpha}{4 F^2 \cos \alpha} $$

Therefore:  
$$ \tan \alpha = \frac{m - 2}{m + 2} $$

### Instructions to solve 1:

1.  
- The maximum value = \( F_1 + F_2 \)  
- The minimum value = \( F_1 - F_2 \) where \( F_1 > F_2 \)  
- \[
\frac{F_1 + F_2}{F_1 - F_2} = \frac{7}{3}
\]  
- \[
3F_1 + 3F_2 = 7F_1 - 7F_2
\]  
- \[
4F_1 = 10F_2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{F_1}{F_2} = \frac{10}{4} = \frac{5}{2}
\]  
- The ratio between the two forces = 5 : 2

2.  
- \( F_1 : F_2 : R = 4 : 3 : \sqrt{13} \)  
- \( F_1 = 4\,m, \quad F_2 = 3\,m, \quad R = \sqrt{13}\,m \)  
- \[
\left(\sqrt{13}\,m\right)^2 = (4\,m)^2 + (3\,m)^2 + 2(4\,m)(3\,m) \cos \alpha
\]  
- \[
\cos \alpha = \frac{13\,m^2 - 16\,m^2 - 9\,m^2}{24\,m^2} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]  
- The measure of the angle between the two forces =  
\[
\cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 120^\circ
\]

3.  
- The resultant \(\perp F_1\)  
- \( F_1 + F_2 \cos \alpha = 0 \)  
- \[
\cos \alpha = -\frac{F_1}{F_2}
\]  
- The measure of the angle between the two forces:  
\[
\cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{F_1}{F_2}\right)
\]

4.  
- The measure of the angle between the two forces = \(90^\circ\)  
- The two forces are unequal  
- The force inclined toward the greater force  
- The measure of the angle \(\theta\) between the greater force and the resultant must be less than \(45^\circ\)

5.  
- Representing the two forces \( \vec{F_1}, \vec{F_2} \) as two adjacent sides in parallelogram as in the opposite figure:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>C</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>D</td>
    <td>
      

<table>
        <tr>
          <td>\(\vec{F_2}\)</td>
          <td>\(\vec{R}\)</td>
          <td>\(\vec{R}\)</td>
        </tr>
<tr>
          <td>\(\vec{F_1}\)</td>
          <td>A</td>
          <td>B</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

- \[
\vec{F_1} + \vec{F_2} = \vec{AB} + \vec{AD} = \vec{AC} = \vec{R}
\]  (1)  
- \[
\vec{F_1} + (-\vec{F_2}) = \vec{AB} + (-\vec{AD}) = \vec{AB} - \vec{AD} = \vec{DB} = \vec{R}
\]  (2)  
- \(\vec{R}\) and \(\vec{R}\) are represented by diagonals of parallelogram  
- In case of \(\vec{R} \perp \vec{R}\), then ABCD is rhombus  
- \[
AB = AD \quad \Rightarrow \quad F_1 = F_2
\]

6.  
- \[
R^2 = F^2 + (4)^2 + 2(F)(4) \cos 120^\circ
\]  
- \[
R^2 = F^2 - 4F + 16
\]  
- \[
R^2 = (F - 2)^2 + 12
\]  
- \[
R = \sqrt{(F - 2)^2 + 12}
\]  
- The smallest value of the resultant is when \( F = 2 \)

7.  
- As \( F_2 \) increases, the resultant leans towards the greater force which is doubled and hence the angle between the resultant and the second force increases.  
- i.e. \(\theta_2 > \theta_1\)  
- The opposite figure shows the idea:

```mermaid
graph LR
  F2_1["F₂"] --- R1["R"]
  F2_2["F₂"] --- R2["R"]
  F1["F₁"]
  subgraph Angles
    theta1["θ₁"]
    theta2["θ₂"]
  end
  F1 --- theta1
  F1 --- theta2
```

8.  
- \[
R^2 = F^2 + 3F^2 + 2(F) \left(\sqrt{3} F\right) \cos \alpha
\]  
- \[
\cos \alpha = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \alpha = 150^\circ
\]  
- \[
\tan \theta_1 = \frac{\sqrt{3} F \sin 150^\circ}{F + \sqrt{3} F \cos 150^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}
\]  
- \[
\theta_1 = 120^\circ \quad \text{and so} \quad \theta_2 = 150^\circ - 120^\circ = 30^\circ
\]  
- \[
\theta_1 = 4 \theta_2
\]

9.  
- \[
3 \leq F_1 \leq 12 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 9 \leq F_1^2 \leq 144
\]  (1)  
- \[
4 \leq F_2 \leq 16 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 16 \leq F_2^2 \leq 256
\]  (2)  
- By adding (1) and (2):  
- \[
25 \leq F_1^2 + F_2^2 \leq 400 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 5 \leq R \leq 20
\]

10.  
- \[
1 \leq F_1 \leq 9, \quad 3 \leq F_2 \leq 7
\]  
- \[
4 \leq F_1 + F_2 \leq 16
\]  (1)  
- \[
1 \leq F_1 \leq 9, \quad -7 \leq -F_2 \leq -3
\]  
- \[
-6 \leq F_1 - F_2 \leq 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 0 \leq |F_1 - F_2| \leq 6
\]  (2)  
- From (1) and (2):  
- \[
0 \leq R \leq 16
\]

# UNIT 1

## (11)

$$5 \leq F_1 \leq 20, \quad 12 \leq F_2 \leq 21$$

$$\therefore 17 \leq F_1 + F_2 \leq 41$$

When $$\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$$

$$(5)^2 + (12)^2 \leq F_1^2 + F_2^2 \leq (20)^2 + (21)^2$$

$$\therefore 169 \leq F_1^2 + F_2^2 \leq 841$$

$$\therefore 13 \leq \sqrt{F_1^2 + F_2^2} \leq 29$$

$$\therefore 13 \leq R \leq 41 \quad \text{when} \quad 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$$

----

## 2

### In the first case:

Let the two forces be F and 2F and the measure of the angle between them = $$\alpha$$

$$\therefore \tan \theta = \frac{2F \sin \alpha}{F + 2F \cos \alpha}, \quad \therefore \tan \theta = \frac{2 \sin \alpha}{1 + 2 \cos \alpha} \quad (1)$$

### In the second case:

The small force = F + 4 and the great force = 4F

$$\therefore \tan \theta = \frac{4F \sin \alpha}{F + 4 + 4F \cos \alpha} \quad (2)$$

From (1) and (2):

$$\frac{2 \sin \alpha}{1 + 2 \cos \alpha} = \frac{4F \sin \alpha}{F + 4 + 4F \cos \alpha}$$

$$\therefore \frac{1}{1 + 2 \cos \alpha} = \frac{2F}{F + 4 + 4F \cos \alpha}$$

$$\therefore F + 4 + 4F \cos \alpha = 2F + 4F \cos \alpha$$

$$\therefore F + 4 = 2F \quad \therefore F = 4 \text{ kg.wt.}$$

### In the first case:

The magnitude of the first force is 4 kg.wt., the magnitude of the second force is 8 kg.wt.

$$\therefore R_1 = \sqrt{16 + 64 + 2 \times 4 \times 8 \cos \alpha} = 4 \sqrt{5 + 4 \cos \alpha}$$

### In the second case:

The magnitude of the first force is 8 kg.wt., the magnitude of the second force is 16 kg.wt.

$$R_2 = \sqrt{64 + 256 + 2 \times 8 \times 16 \cos \alpha} = 8 \sqrt{5 + 4 \cos \alpha}$$

$$\therefore \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{4 \sqrt{5 + 4 \cos \alpha}}{8 \sqrt{5 + 4 \cos \alpha}} = \frac{1}{2}$$

----

## 3

### In the first case:

$$R^2 = F_1^2 + F_2^2 + 2 F_1 F_2 \cos \alpha \quad (1)$$

### In the second case:

$$3 R^2 = F_1^2 + F_2^2 + 2 F_1 F_2 \cos (180^\circ - \alpha)$$

$$\therefore 3 R^2 = F_1^2 + F_2^2 - 2 F_1 F_2 \cos \alpha \quad (2)$$

Multiplying (1) by 3, then subtracting (2) from (1):

$$\therefore \text{zero} = 2 F_1^2 + 2 F_2^2 + 8 F_1 F_2 \cos \alpha$$

$$\therefore \cos \alpha = \frac{-F_1^2 - F_2^2}{4 F_1 F_2} \quad (3)$$

Let $$\theta_1$$ be the inclination angle of R on $$F_1$$

$$\therefore \tan \theta_1 = \frac{F_2 \sin \alpha}{F_1 + F_2 \cos \alpha}$$

Let $$\theta_2$$ be the inclination angle of $$R \sqrt{3}$$ on $$F_1$$

$$\therefore \tan \theta_2 = \frac{F_2 \sin (180^\circ - \alpha)}{F_1 + F_2 \cos (180^\circ - \alpha)} = \frac{F_2 \sin \alpha}{F_1 - F_2 \cos \alpha}$$

$$\tan \theta_2 = \frac{F_2 \sin \alpha}{F_1 - F_2 \cos \alpha}$$

$$\therefore \theta_1 + \theta_2 = 90^\circ \quad \therefore \tan \theta_1 = \cot \theta_2$$

$$\therefore \frac{F_2 \sin \alpha}{F_1 + F_2 \cos \alpha} = \frac{F_1 - F_2 \cos \alpha}{F_2 \sin \alpha}$$

$$\therefore F_2^2 \sin^2 \alpha = F_1^2 - F_2^2 \cos^2 \alpha$$

$$\therefore F_2^2 (\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha) = F_1^2$$

$$\therefore F_2^2 = F_1^2$$

$$\therefore F_2 = F_1$$

Substituting in (3):

$$\therefore \cos \alpha = \frac{-2 F_1^2}{4 F_1^2} = -\frac{1}{2}$$

$$\therefore \alpha = 120^\circ$$

### Another solution:

$$\therefore AD = AK = BC = BJ$$

In $$\triangle ACJ$$:

$$m(\angle CAJ) = 90^\circ \quad \text{(given)}$$

and $$\overline{AB}$$ is a median from the vertex of the right angle

$$\therefore AB = \frac{1}{2} JC = BJ = BC \quad \therefore F_1 = F_2$$

$$\tan (\angle CJA) = \frac{R}{R \sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$$

$$\therefore m(\angle CJA) = 30^\circ \quad \therefore m(\angle ACB) = 60^\circ$$

$$\therefore \triangle ABC \text{ is equilateral triangle}$$

$$\therefore m(\angle ACB) = m(\angle CAB) = m(\angle CAD) = 60^\circ$$

$$\therefore \alpha = 120^\circ$$

$$ 4 + 4 \sqrt{3} \cos (\angle ABE) - 10 = 0 $$

$$ \cos (\angle ABE) = \frac{6}{4 \sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} $$

$$ m(\angle ABE) = 30^\circ $$

Using the \(Y\) component:

$$ 4 \sin 0^\circ + 4 \sqrt{3} \sin 30^\circ + F \sin 90^\circ + 10 \sqrt{2} \sin 225^\circ = 0 $$

$$ 4 \times 0 + 4 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{1}{2} + F \times 1 + 10 \sqrt{2} \times \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} = 0 $$

$$ 2 \sqrt{3} + F - 10 = 0 $$

$$ F = 10 - 2 \sqrt{3} = 2 (5 - \sqrt{3}) \text{ kg.wt.} $$

### 22. Forces in equilibrium with force of magnitude 5 kg.wt acting in direction of OX

- Forces are in equilibrium:

$$ X = Y = 0 $$

- \(X\) component:

$$
\begin{aligned}
X &= 5 \cos 0^\circ + 4 \cos 60^\circ + F \cos 120^\circ + 3 \cos 180^\circ + K \cos 240^\circ + 7 \cos 300^\circ = 0 \\
&= 5 \times 1 + 4 \times \frac{1}{2} + F \times \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 3 \times (-1) + K \times \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 7 \times \frac{1}{2} = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Simplify:

$$ F + K = 15 \quad (1) $$

- \(Y\) component:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y &= 5 \sin 0^\circ + 4 \sin 60^\circ + F \sin 120^\circ + 3 \sin 180^\circ + K \sin 240^\circ + 7 \sin 300^\circ = 0 \\
&= 5 \times 0 + 4 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + F \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 3 \times 0 + K \times \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + 7 \times \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Simplify:

$$ F - K = 3 \quad (2) $$

Solving equations (1) and (2):

$$ F = 9 \text{ kg.wt.}, \quad K = 6 \text{ kg.wt.} $$

### 23. Forces in equilibrium

- \(X\) component:

$$
\begin{aligned}
X &= F \cos 0^\circ + 6 \cos 90^\circ + 4 \sqrt{2} \cos 135^\circ + 5 \sqrt{2} \cos 225^\circ + K \cos 270^\circ \\
&= F \times 1 + 6 \times 0 + 4 \sqrt{2} \times \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + 5 \sqrt{2} \times \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + K \times 0 \\
&= F - 4 - 5 = F - 9
\end{aligned}
$$

- \(Y\) component:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y &= F \sin 0^\circ + 6 \sin 90^\circ + 4 \sqrt{2} \sin 135^\circ + 5 \sqrt{2} \sin 225^\circ + K \sin 270^\circ \\
&= F \times 0 + 6 \times 1 + 4 \sqrt{2} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 5 \sqrt{2} \times \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + K \times (-1) \\
&= 6 + 4 - 5 - K = 5 - K
\end{aligned}
$$

Resultant:

$$ \vec{R} = (F - 9) \hat{i} + (5 - K) \hat{j} $$

Given resultant is 2 newton in the direction of North,

$$ F - 9 = 0 \implies F = 9 \text{ newton} $$

$$ 5 - K = 2 \implies K = 3 \text{ newton} $$

### 24. Polar angle of \(\vec{F}\)

Let the measure of the polar angle of \(\vec{F}\) be \(\alpha\).

$$
X = F \cos \alpha + 4 \sqrt{3} \cos 90^\circ + 12 \sqrt{3} \cos 150^\circ + 36 \cos 300^\circ

Applying the triangle of forces rule:

$$\frac{F_1}{3} = \frac{F_2}{4} = \frac{75}{5}$$

$$F_1 = \frac{3 \times 75}{5} = 45 \text{ newton}$$

$$F_2 = \frac{4 \times 75}{5} = 60 \text{ newton}$$

----

#### 2

Applying Lami's rule:

$$\frac{60}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{K}{\sin 120^\circ} = \frac{F}{\sin 150^\circ}$$

$$F = 30 \text{ newton}$$

----

#### 3

Applying Lami's rule:

$$\frac{F}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{r}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{12}{\sin 120^\circ}$$

$$\frac{F}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{r}{1} = \frac{12}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$$

$$F = \frac{12 \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = 4 \sqrt{3} \text{ kg.wt.}$$

$$\frac{36}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{W}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{r}{\sin 120^\circ}$$

$$W = \frac{36 \sin 90^\circ}{\sin 150^\circ} = 72 \text{ newton}$$

* The three forces are in equilibrium.  
* The resultant of the two forces $\vec{F}_2$ and $\vec{F}_3$ equals in magnitude $\vec{F}_1$.

$$ (8)^2 = \left(4 \sqrt{3}\right)^2 + (4)^2 + 2 \times 4 \sqrt{3} \times 4 \cos \alpha_1 $$

$$64 = 64 + 32 \sqrt{3} \cos \alpha_1$$

$$\cos \alpha_1 = 0 \implies \alpha_1 = 90^\circ$$

The resultant of the two forces $\vec{F}_1$ and $\vec{F}_3$ equals $\vec{F}_2$ in magnitude:

$$\left(4 \sqrt{3}\right)^2 = (8)^2 + (4)^2 + 2 \times 8 \times 4 \cos \alpha_2$$

$$48 = 80 + 64 \cos \alpha_2 \implies \cos \alpha_2 = -\frac{1}{2}$$

$$\alpha_2 = 120^\circ$$

$$\alpha_3 = 360^\circ - (90^\circ + 120^\circ) = 150^\circ$$

* The measures of the angles between forces are:  
  $$90^\circ, 120^\circ, 150^\circ$$

#### 6

From the figure:

$$m(\angle EMF) = 90^\circ$$

$$m(\angle DME) = m(\angle DMF) = 135^\circ$$

Applying Lami's rule:

$$\frac{F_1}{\sin 135^\circ} = \frac{F_2}{\sin 135^\circ} = \frac{42}{\sin 90^\circ}$$

$$\frac{F_1}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} = \frac{F_2}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} = \frac{42}{1}$$

$$F_1 = F_2 = 42 \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 21 \sqrt{2} \text{ gm.wt.}$$

$$
\frac{T_1}{\sin 130^\circ} = \frac{T_2}{\sin 120^\circ} = \frac{10}{\sin 110^\circ}

$$
\therefore T_1 = \frac{10 \times \sin 130^\circ}{\sin 110^\circ} = 8.15 \text{ newton}

Let the angle between the inclined plane and the horizontal measure \(\theta\),

$$
\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \quad \therefore \theta = 30^\circ
$$

Applying Lami's rule,

$$
\frac{F}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{r}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{15}{\sin 60^\circ}

# 10

Let the measure of the angle between the plane and the horizontal be \(\theta\),

$$
\cos \theta = \frac{1}{2} \quad \therefore \theta = 60^\circ

$$

$$
\frac{6.5}{1} = \frac{T_1}{\frac{12}{13}} = \frac{T_2}{\frac{5}{13}}

Suppose that the inclination angles of the two strings to the vertical be of measures \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) from Lami's rule,

$$
\frac{50}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{25}{\sin \theta_1} = \frac{25 \sqrt{3}}{\sin \theta_2}

$$
\theta_1 = 30^\circ, \quad \sin \theta_2 = \frac{25 \sqrt{3} \times \sin 90^\circ}{50} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

\]

\[
\frac{F}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{r}{\sin 60^\circ} = \frac{300}{\sin 60^\circ}
\]

\[
\frac{F}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{r}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{300}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}
\]

\[
F = r = \frac{300 \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = 100 \sqrt{3} \text{ gm.wt.}
\]

----

### Problem 23

Applying Lami's rule:

\[
\frac{800}{\sin(90^\circ + \theta)} = \frac{r}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{F}{\sin(180^\circ - \theta)}
\]

\[
\frac{800}{\cos \theta} = \frac{r}{1} = \frac{F}{\sin \theta}
\]

\[
r = 800 \div \cos \theta = 800 \times \frac{10}{8} = 1000 \text{ gm.wt.}

\[
F = 800 \times \sin \theta \div \cos \theta = 800 \times \frac{6}{8} = 600 \text{ gm.wt.}
\]

----

### Problem 24

- The tensions in the two branches of the string are equal in magnitudes.
- Draw \(DF \parallel BC\) and cuts \(AC\) at \(F\).
- \(F\) is the midpoint of \(AC\).
- \(\triangle CDF\) is the triangle of forces.

\[
\frac{150}{12} = \frac{T}{7.5} = \frac{T}{7.5} \implies T = \frac{7.5 \times 150}{12} = 93.75 \text{ gm.wt.}
\]

----

### Problem 25

1. 

\[
AB = \sqrt{(130)^2 - (50)^2} = 120 \text{ cm}
\]

From the figure we get \(\triangle ABC\) is the triangle of forces.

\[
\frac{T}{130} = \frac{F}{50} = \frac{24}{120}
\]

\[
T = \frac{24 \times 130}{120} = 26 \text{ newton}
\]

\[
F = \frac{24 \times 50}{120} = 10 \text{ newton}
\]

2. Using Lami's rule:

\[
\frac{T}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{F}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{24}{\sin 120^\circ}
\]

\[
\frac{T}{1} = \frac{F}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{24}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}
\]

\[
T = \frac{24}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = 16 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}
\]

\[
F = \frac{24 \times \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = 8 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}
\]

----

### Problem 26

\[
AC = \sqrt{(25)^2 - (7)^2} = 24 \text{ cm}
\]

\(\triangle ABC\) is the triangle of forces.

\[
\frac{72}{AC} = \frac{T_1}{CB} = \frac{T_2}{BA}
\]

\[
\frac{72}{24} = \frac{T_1}{7} = \frac{T_2}{25}
\]

\[
T_1 = \frac{7 \times 72}{24} = 21 \text{ gm.wt.}
\]

\[
T_2 = \frac{25 \times 72}{24} = 75 \text{ gm.wt.}
\]

- The tension in the horizontal string = 21 gm.wt.
- The tension in each part of the first string = 75 and 72 gm.wt.

----

### Problem 27

Using Lami's rule:

\[
\frac{100}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{T}{\sin (180^\circ - \theta)} = \frac{200}{\sin (30^\circ + \theta)}
\]

\[
\frac{100}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{T}{\sin \theta} = \frac{200}{\sin (30^\circ + \theta)}
\]

\[
\sin (30^\circ + \theta) = \frac{200 \times \frac{1}{2}}{100} = 1
\]

\[
30^\circ + \theta = 90^\circ
\]

----

### Additional Calculations

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{6 \times \frac{1}{2}}{2 \sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

\[
\theta = 30^\circ
\]

The string makes an angle of measure \(30^\circ\) with the plane.

\[
r = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{1}{2}}{\sin (120^\circ + 30^\circ)} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} \sin 150^\circ}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \sqrt{3} \text{ kg.wt.}
\]

$$K = \frac{20 \times \sin 90^\circ}{\sin 150^\circ} = 40 \text{ kg.wt.}$$

----

### Third Higher skills

### 1

$$T_2 = 300 \text{ gm.wt.}$$

Using Lami's rule:

$$\frac{T_1}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{300}{\sin (180^\circ - \theta)} = \frac{400}{\sin (90^\circ + \theta)}$$

$$\therefore \frac{T_1}{\sin \theta} = \frac{300}{\sin \theta} = \frac{400}{\cos \theta}$$

$$\therefore \sin \theta = \frac{300}{400} = \frac{3}{4}$$

$$\therefore \tan \theta = \frac{3}{4}$$

$$\therefore \text{The angle of inclination of } AB \text{ to the vertical measures } 36^\circ 52'$$

$$\frac{20}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{T_2}{\sin 120^\circ} = \frac{T_3}{\sin 90^\circ} \quad \therefore \frac{20}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{T_2}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{T_3}{1}$$

$$\therefore T_2 = \frac{20 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = 20 \sqrt{3} \text{ gm.wt.}$$

$$T_3 = \frac{20 \times 1}{\frac{1}{2}} = 40 \text{ gm.wt.}$$

Substituting in (1):

$$\frac{T_1}{1} = \frac{20 \sqrt{3}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{K}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$$

$$\therefore T_1 = 40 \sqrt{3} \text{ gm.wt.}, \quad K = \frac{20 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = 60 \text{ gm.wt.}$$

## Second: Essay questions

### 1

\(\triangle MAB\) is the triangle of forces where:  
MA = 30 + 20 = 50 cm.  
BM = 30 cm.  
\(\therefore AB = 40 \text{ cm}\).  
(pythagoras theorem)  

Applying the triangle of forces rule:  
$$\frac{r}{BM} = \frac{T}{MA} = \frac{200}{AB}$$  
$$\frac{r}{30} = \frac{T}{50} = \frac{200}{40}$$  
$$r = 200 \times \frac{30}{40} = 150 \text{ gm.wt.}$$  
$$T = 200 \times \frac{50}{40} = 250 \text{ gm.wt.}$$  

### 2

* The wall is smooth  
* \(\vec{r} \perp\) the wall  
* The set of forces are in equilibrium.  
* \(\vec{T}\) passes through the point M  

Applying Lami's rule:  
$$\frac{T}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{10 \sqrt{3}}{\sin 120^\circ} = \frac{r}{\sin 150^\circ}$$  
$$T = 20 \text{ gm.wt.} \quad r = 10 \text{ gm.wt.}$$  

### 3

* The wall is smooth  
* \(\vec{R} \perp\) the wall  
* The set of forces are in equilibrium.  
* \(\vec{T}\) passes through the point M  

\(\triangle ABM\) is the triangle of forces where AM = 2r, MB = r, AB = \(\sqrt{3} r\)  

Applying the triangle of forces rule:  
$$\frac{T}{2r} = \frac{R}{r} = \frac{15}{\sqrt{3} r}$$  
$$T = 10 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}$$  
$$R = 5 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}$$  

\(\therefore\) The pressure on the wall = \(5 \sqrt{3}\) newton  

### 4

Since the two planes are smooth:  
\(\therefore r_1\) and \(r_2\) are perpendicular to the two planes and pass through the center of the sphere.  

Applying Lami's rule:  
$$\frac{r_1}{\sin 120^\circ} = \frac{r_2}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{15}{\sin 150^\circ}$$  

\(\therefore r_1\) (The reaction of the vertical plane) = \(15 \sqrt{3}\) kg.wt.  
\(r_2\) (The reaction of the inclined plane) = 30 kg.wt.  

### 5

* The set of forces are in equilibrium.  
* The line of action of the weight passes through the point of meeting of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) which is the point C.  
* \(AC = \frac{1}{2} AB\)  
* \(\angle ACB\) is right-angle  
* \(\therefore m(\angle B) = 30^\circ\)  
* \(\therefore m(\angle A) = m(\angle ACD) = 60^\circ\)  

Applying Lami's rule:  
$$\frac{T_1}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{T_2}{\sin 120^\circ} = \frac{30}{\sin 90^\circ}$$  
$$T_1 = 30 \times \frac{1}{2} = 15 \text{ kg.wt.}$$  
$$T_2 = 30 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 15 \sqrt{3} \text{ kg.wt.}$$  

### 6

* The two lines of action of tensions are meeting at the point of suspending.  
* The line of action of the weight should pass through the same point as shown in the figure.  

$$(AC)^2 + (BC)^2 = 16900$$  
$$(AB)^2 = 16900$$  
\(\therefore m(\angle ACB) = 90^\circ\)  

----

From (1) and (2):  
\(\therefore T_1 > T_2\)  

i.e. The tension in the string when fixing at A, B is greater than the tension when fixing at C, D.

# Unit 1

$$\sin \theta_1 = \frac{12}{13}, \quad \sin \theta_2 = \frac{5}{13}$$

Applying Lami's theorem

$$\frac{T_1}{\sin \theta_1} = \frac{T_2}{\sin \theta_2} = \frac{26}{\sin 90^\circ}$$

$$\Rightarrow \frac{T_1}{\frac{12}{13}} = \frac{T_2}{\frac{5}{13}} = 26$$

$$\Rightarrow T_1 = 24 \text{ newton} \quad T_2 = 10 \text{ newton}$$

$$AE = \frac{1}{2} BC = 30 \sqrt{2} \text{ cm}, \quad EC = 30 \sqrt{2} \text{ cm}$$

$$AC = 60 \text{ cm}$$

$$\Rightarrow \frac{r}{30 \sqrt{2}} = \frac{T}{30 \sqrt{2}} = \frac{40}{60} \quad \Rightarrow r = T = 20 \sqrt{2} \text{ newton}$$

$$EC = 40 \sqrt{3} \quad AC = 80 \text{ cm}$$

* \( AE = 40 \text{ cm} \) (Pythagoras theorem)

\(\triangle AEC\) is the triangle of forces

$$\Rightarrow \frac{r}{40} = \frac{T}{40 \sqrt{3}} = \frac{24}{80} \quad \Rightarrow r = 40 \times \frac{24}{80} = 12 \text{ kg.wt.}$$

$$T = 40 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{24}{80} = 12 \sqrt{3} \text{ kg.wt.}$$

* The rod is a tangent to the sphere.
* The reaction is perpendicular to the rod.
* \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \) are passing through the centre of the sphere.

Applying Lami's rule

$$\frac{r_1}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{r_2}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{60}{\sin 60^\circ}$$

$$\Rightarrow r_1 = r_2 = 20 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}$$

$$\Rightarrow P_1 = P_2 = 20 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}$$

----

## 10

\(\triangle MAB\) is the triangle of forces

$$\frac{50}{MA} = \frac{25}{BM} = \frac{W}{AB}$$

$$\frac{MA}{MB} = \frac{50}{25} = 2$$

$$\Rightarrow MA = 2 \times 12 = 24$$

The length of the string

$$CA = 24 - 12 = 12 \text{ cm}$$

From \(\triangle MAB\) which is right-angled at B

$$AB = 12 \sqrt{3}$$

$$\Rightarrow \frac{25}{12} = \frac{W}{12 \sqrt{3}}$$

$$\Rightarrow W = 25 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}$$

----

## 11

* The set of forces are in equilibrium.
* The line of action of the weight passes through the intersection point of \(\vec{T_1}\) and \(\vec{T_2}\) which is (C).
* The two strings are perpendicular.
* \(\triangle ABC\) is right-angled.
* The length of the other string = 64 cm.

$$\sin \theta_1 = \frac{48}{80} = \frac{3}{5}, \quad \sin \theta_2 = \frac{64}{80} = \frac{4}{5}$$

Applying Lami's rule

$$\frac{T_1}{\sin \theta_1} = \frac{T_2}{\sin \theta_2} = \frac{12}{\sin 90^\circ}$$

$$\Rightarrow \frac{T_1}{\frac{3}{5}} = \frac{T_2}{\frac{4}{5}} = 12$$

$$\Rightarrow T_1 = 7.2 \text{ newton}$$

$$T_2 = 9.6 \text{ newton}$$

## 12

---


DN = AE = 3 metres, BN = 1.25 metre  
From Δ DNB which are right angled at N,  
then BD = 3.25 metres (Pythagoras)  

∴ Δ NBD is the triangle of forces, then applying the rule of the triangle of forces,  

$$\frac{r_1}{NB} = \frac{r_2}{BD} = \frac{36}{DN}$$  

$$\frac{r_1}{1.25} = \frac{r_2}{3.25} = \frac{36}{3}$$  

∴ \(r_1 = 15 \, \text{kg.wt.}\), \(r_2 = 39 \, \text{kg.wt.}\)  

----

### 13

* The set of forces are in equilibrium.  
* \(r\) passes through the point E  
* BC = 100 cm. (Pythagoras theorem)  

$$\frac{BD}{BA} = \frac{BE}{BC} = \frac{ED}{CA}$$  

$$\therefore \frac{2}{3} = \frac{BE}{100} = \frac{ED}{80}$$  

∴ \(BE = \frac{200}{3} \, \text{cm}\), \(ED = \frac{160}{3} \, \text{cm}\)  

From Δ ADE: AE = \(\frac{20 \sqrt{73}}{3}\) cm. (Pythagoras)  

∴ Δ AEC is the triangle of forces. Applying the triangle of forces rule,  

$$\frac{r}{\frac{20 \sqrt{73}}{3}} = \frac{T}{100} = \frac{16}{80}$$  

∴ \(r = \frac{4}{3} \sqrt{73} \, \text{kg.wt.}\)  
\(T = \frac{20}{3} = 6 \frac{2}{3} \, \text{kg.wt.}\)  

----

### 14

* The rod is in equilibrium under the action of three forces meeting at the point N.  
* Using lami's we get  

$$\frac{8}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{T}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{r}{\sin 120^\circ}$$  

$$\therefore \frac{8}{1} = \frac{T}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{r}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$$  

∴ \(T = 4 \, \text{kg.wt.}\), \(r = 4 \sqrt{3} \, \text{kg.wt.}\)  

----

### 15

* The set of forces are in equilibrium.  
* The weight and the tension are meeting at the point (N).  
* The line of action of \(r\) should pass through N.  
* \(DN \parallel AC\), D is the midpoint of \(\overline{AB}\).  
* N is the midpoint of \(\overline{BC}\).  
* Δ ANC is the triangle of forces where NC = 40 cm, CA = 100 cm.  

$$(AC)^2 = 10000, \quad (AB)^2 + (BC)^2 = 10000$$  

∴ \(m(\angle B) = 90^\circ\)  
∴ Δ NBA is right-angled.  

$$AN = \sqrt{(40)^2 + (60)^2} = 20 \sqrt{13} \, \text{cm}$$  

Applying the triangle of forces rule we get  

$$\frac{r}{20 \sqrt{13}} = \frac{T}{40} = \frac{W}{100}$$  

∴ \(T = \frac{2}{5} W \, \text{kg.wt.}\)  

$$r = \frac{\sqrt{13}}{5} W \, \text{kg.wt.}$$  

Supposing that \(\theta\) is the measure of the angle between \(r\) and the rod,  

∴ In Δ NBA which is right-angled at B,  

$$\tan \theta = \frac{40}{60} = \frac{2}{3} \quad \therefore \theta = 33^\circ 41'$$  

----

### 16

In Δ ADC:  

$$AD = \sqrt{(50)^2 - (30)^2} = 40 \, \text{cm}$$  

* The set of forces are in equilibrium.  
* \(r\) passes through N.  
* Δ CAD \(\sim\) Δ CMN (because of the equality of measures of their corresponding angles)  

$$\frac{CA}{CM} = \frac{AD}{MN} = \frac{CD}{CN} = \frac{30}{15} = \frac{40}{MN} = \frac{50}{CN}$$  

∴ MN = 20 cm, CN = 25 cm.  
∴ DN = 50 + 25 = 75 cm.  

From Δ AMN we get \(AN = 5 \sqrt{97}\) cm. (Pythagoras)  

∴ Δ AND is the triangle of forces.  

$$\frac{T}{75} = \frac{r}{5 \sqrt{97}} = \frac{W}{40}$$  

∴ \(T = \frac{15}{8} W \, \text{kg.wt.}\)  

$$r = \frac{\sqrt{97}}{8} W \, \text{kg.wt.}$$

# UNIT 1

## Problem 25

- ∠ENA is an exterior angle of the isosceles triangle ENC where EN = NC = 10 cm.
- m(∠CEN) = 30°
- Applying Lami's rule:

$$
\frac{r}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{T}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{12}{\sin 120^\circ}
$$

- Therefore,

$$
r = 4 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}, \quad T = 8 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}
$$

----

## Problem 26

- AC = AD = 4 metres
- m(∠ACD) = 45°
- CD = \(4 \sqrt{2}\) metres

From ΔMCN:

- MN = 1 metre, NC = \(\sqrt{2}\) metres
- DN = \(4 \sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2} = 3 \sqrt{2}\) metres

From ΔAMN:

- AN = \(\sqrt{10}\) metres (Pythagoras)

Since ΔAND is the triangle of forces:

$$
\frac{r}{\sqrt{10}} = \frac{T}{3 \sqrt{2}} = \frac{8}{4}
$$

Therefore,

$$
r = 2 \sqrt{10} \text{ kg.wt.}, \quad T = 6 \sqrt{2} \text{ kg.wt.}
$$

----

## Problem 27

- The body is in equilibrium
- \(X = 0, Y = 0\)

Equilibrium equation:

$$
F \cos \alpha + r \cos 90^\circ + 100 \cos (270^\circ - \theta) = 0
$$

Substitute values:

$$
F \times \frac{12}{13} + r \times 0 + 100 \times (-\sin \theta) = 0
$$

$$
\frac{12}{13} F - 100 \times \frac{3}{5} = 0
$$

Therefore,

$$
F = 65 \text{ newton}
$$

Also,

$$
F \sin \alpha + r \sin 90^\circ + 100 \sin (270^\circ - \theta) = 0
$$

$$
65 \times \frac{5}{13} + r \times 1 + 100 \times (-\cos \theta) = 0
$$

$$
25 + r - 100 \times \frac{4}{5} = 0
$$

Therefore,

$$
r = 55 \text{ newton}
$$

----

## Problem 28

- The body is in equilibrium
- \(X = 0, Y = 0\)

Equilibrium in X-direction:

$$
50 \cos 0^\circ + 20 \sqrt{3} \cos 30^\circ + r \cos 90^\circ + W \cos 240^\circ = 0
$$

Simplify:

$$
50 \times 1 + 20 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + r \times 0 + W \times (-\cos 60^\circ) = 0
$$

$$
50 + 30 + 0 - \frac{1}{2} W = 0
$$

Therefore,

$$
W = 160 \text{ newton}
$$

Equilibrium in Y-direction:

$$
50 \sin 0^\circ + 20 \sqrt{3} \sin 30^\circ + r \sin 90^\circ + W \sin 240^\circ = 0
$$

Simplify:

$$
50 \times 0 + 20 \sqrt{3} \times \frac{1}{2} + r \times 1 - W \sin 60^\circ = 0
$$

$$
0 + 10 \sqrt{3} + r - 160 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0
$$

Therefore,

$$
r = 70 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}
$$

----

## Problem 29

- ΔABC in which
- m(∠B) = 90°, AC + CB = 40
- Therefore, AC = 40 - CB

Using Pythagoras theorem:

$$
(AC)^2 = (AB)^2 + (BC)^2
$$

$$
(40 - BC)^2 = (20)^2 + (BC)^2
$$

Expanding:

$$
1600 - 80 BC + (BC)^2 = 400 + (BC)^2
$$

Simplify:

$$
80 BC = 1200
$$

Therefore,

$$
BC = 15 \text{ cm}, \quad AC = 25 \text{ cm}
$$

- The ring is smooth
- The tension in CA = the tension in CB = T
- The ring is in equilibrium
- \(X = 0, Y = 0\)

Equilibrium in X-direction:

$$
T \cos (90^\circ - \theta) + T \cos 90^\circ + F \cos 180^\circ + 400 \cos 270^\circ = 0
$$

Simplify:

$$
T \sin \theta + T \times 0 + F \times (-1) + 400 \times 0 = 0
$$

$$
T \times \frac{20}{25} - F = 0
$$

Therefore,

$$
4T - 5F = 0 \quad (1)
$$

Equilibrium in Y-direction:

$$
T \sin (90^\circ - \theta) + T \sin 90^\circ + F \sin 180^\circ + 400 \sin 270^\circ = 0
$$

Simplify:

$$
T \cos \theta + T + F \times 0 + 400 \times (-1) = 0
$$

$$
T \times \frac{15}{25} + T - 400 = 0
$$

$$
\frac{8}{5} T = 400
$$

Therefore,

$$
T = 250 \text{ gm.wt.}
$$

Substituting in (1):

$$
1000 - 5F = 0
$$

Therefore,

$$
F = 200 \text{ gm.wt.}
$$

# Geometry and Measurement

$$
h = \sqrt{l^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{(18)^2 - 3^2} = 3 \sqrt{35}
$$

Volume of the cone:
$$
= \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times (3)^2 \times 3 \sqrt{35} \approx 167.3 \text{ cm}^3
$$

## 22

The length of the drawer of the cone = 20 cm.

The perimeter of the circle of the cone:
$$
= \text{the length of } AB = r \theta^{rad}
$$
$$
= 20 \times \frac{90^\circ \times \pi}{180^\circ} = 10 \pi
$$

Therefore,
$$
2 \pi r = 10 \pi \implies r = 5 \text{ cm}
$$

$$
h = \sqrt{(20)^2 - (5)^2} = 5 \sqrt{15}
$$

Volume of the cone:
$$
= \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times (5)^2 \times 5 \sqrt{15} = \frac{125 \sqrt{15}}{3} \pi \text{ cm}^3

The volume:
$$
= \frac{1}{3} \pi \times 6^2 \times 8 = 96 \pi \text{ cm}^3
$$

2) The formed solid is formed from two cones with common base whose radius:
$$
= \frac{6 \times 8}{10} = 4.8 \text{ cm}
$$

- Length of the 1st drawer = 8 cm.
- $$ h_1 = \sqrt{8^2 - 4.8^2} = 6.4 \text{ cm} $$
- Length of the 2nd drawer = 6 cm.
- $$ h_2 = \sqrt{6^2 - 4.8^2} = 3.6 \text{ cm} $$

Volume of resultant solid:
$$
= \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times (4.8)^2 \times 6.4 + \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times (4.8)^2 \times 3.6 = 76.8 \pi \text{ cm}^3

$$

The height:
$$

$$

The volume:
$$
= \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = \frac{1}{3} \pi \times (6)^2 \times 12 \sqrt{2} = 144 \sqrt{2} \pi \text{ cm}^3

$$

- **Second cone:** \( h_2 = 120 \text{ cm}, r_2 = 50 \text{ cm} \)

$$
l_2 = \sqrt{(120)^2 + (50)^2} = 130 \text{ cm}
$$

The lateral area:

**Volume of the pentagonal pyramid**

$$
= \frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times \text{height}
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{5}{4} \times 10^2 \times \cot \frac{\pi}{5} \times 42 \right)
$$

$$
= 2408.67 \text{ cm}^3

$$
\therefore \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = 2167.8
$$

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times (15)^2 \times h = 2167.8

$$
h = \frac{2167.8}{\frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times 15^2} \approx 9.2 \text{ cm}

## 29

The volume of the cone = $$\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = 100 \text{ cm}^3$$

1) After doubling its height

- The volume of the resultant cone

$$
= \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 (2h) = 2 \left[ \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \right]
= 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cm}^3
$$

2) After doubling its radius length

- The volume of the resultant cone

= \frac{1}{3} \pi (2r)^2 (h) = \frac{1}{3} \pi \times 4 r^2 h
= 4 \left[ \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \right] = 4 \times 100 = 400 \text{ cm}^3

**Instructions to solve 1:**

1) The volume of hemisphere = The volume of the cone.

$$
\therefore \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \right) = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \quad \therefore h = 2r
$$

----

2) 

$$
\therefore AM = \sqrt{(5k)^2 - (3k)^2} = 4k
$$

- The volume of the cone = $$96 \pi$$

$$
\therefore \frac{1}{3} \pi \times (3k)^2 \times 4k = 96 \pi
$$

$$
12 k^3 = 96 \quad \therefore k^3 = 8
$$

$$
\therefore k = 2
$$

$$
\therefore r = 6 \text{ cm}, \quad h = 8 \text{ cm}, \quad l = 10 \text{ cm}
$$

$$
\therefore \text{The total area} = \pi r (r + l) = \pi \times 6 \times (6 + 10) = 96 \pi \text{ cm}^2
$$

----

3) 

- The volume of the cone = $$49 \pi$$

$$
\therefore \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = 49 \pi \quad \therefore \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 \times 3 = 49 \pi
$$

$$
\therefore r^2 = 49 \quad \therefore r = 7 \text{ cm}
$$

- The length of the arc of the folded sector

$$
= 2 \pi r = 2 \pi \times 7 = 14 \pi \text{ cm}
$$

----

4) Let the radius of the smallest cone = \(r_1\) and its height = \(h_1\), and its drawer = \(l_1\)

Let the radius of the greatest cone = \(r_2\) and its height = \(h_2\), and its drawer = \(l_2\)

From the figure we find:

$$
\frac{h_1}{h_2} = \frac{l_1}{l_2} = \frac{r_1}{r_2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

**First:**

The volume of the smallest cone  
-------------------------------  
The volume of the greatest cone

$$
= \frac{1}{3} \pi r_1^2 h_1 \div \frac{1}{3} \pi r_2^2 h_2 = \left(\frac{r_1}{r_2}\right)^2 \times \frac{h_1}{h_2} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}
$$

**Second:**

The lateral area of the smallest cone  
------------------------------------  
The lateral area of the greatest cone

$$
= \frac{\pi r_1 l_1}{\pi r_2 l_2} = \frac{r_1}{r_2} \times \frac{l_1}{l_2} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

----

5) From the figure we find:

- The area of the base of the pyramid

$$
= \frac{1}{2} \times \left( 2 \sqrt{3} r \right) \times 3r = 3 \sqrt{3} r^2
$$

- The area of the base of the cone = \(\pi r^2\)

----

**The volume of the regular triangular pyramid**

*The volume of the greatest cone can be put inside the pyramid*

$$
= \frac{1}{3} \times 3 \sqrt{3} r^2 \times h \div \frac{1}{3} \times \pi r^2 \times h = \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{\pi}
$$

# Geometry and Measurement

(6) From the figure we find:

* The area of the base of the pyramid  
  $$= 3 \times \left(\frac{1}{2} r^2 \sin 120^\circ \right)$$  
  $$= \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{4} r^2$$

* The area of the base of the cone  
  $$= \pi r^2$$

* The volume of the regular triangular pyramid  
  The volume of the smallest cone that contains it  
  $$
  = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{4} r^2 \times h = \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{4 \pi}
  $$

(7) Let the radius of the base of the cone = \(r\) and its height = \(h\) and its volume = \(v\).

* After increasing, we find that the radius of the base of the cone is \(\frac{3}{2} r\), its height = \(\frac{3}{2} h\) and its volume \(\hat{v}\):

  $$
  \frac{\hat{v}}{v} = \frac{\frac{1}{3} \pi \left(\frac{3}{2} r\right)^2 \times \left(\frac{3}{2} h\right)}{\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 \times h} = \frac{9}{4} \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{27}{8}
  $$

  Therefore,  
  $$
  \hat{v} = \frac{27}{8} v \quad \Rightarrow \quad \hat{v} = 337.5\% \, v
  $$

## Problem 2

Given the lines:

$$L_1: 3x - \sqrt{3} y = -6$$ dividing by \(-6\)  
$$\Rightarrow \frac{x}{-2} + \frac{y}{2 \sqrt{3}} = 1$$

$$L_2: \sqrt{3} x + y = 2 \sqrt{3}$$ dividing by \(2 \sqrt{3}\)  
$$\Rightarrow \frac{x}{2} + \frac{y}{2 \sqrt{3}} = 1$$

Points:  
$$A(0, 2 \sqrt{3}), \quad B(2, 0), \quad C(-2, 0)$$

* By rotation about the X-axis, make two cones with the same base of radius length \(= 2 \sqrt{3}\) units and the same height (h = 2 units).

* Therefore, the two cones are congruent.

* The volume of the resultant solid:  
  $$
  = 2 \times \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \left(2 \sqrt{3}\right)^2 \times 2 = 16 \pi \text{ cubic units}
  $$

----

## Problem 3

(1) The formed solid from the rotation is a right circular cylinder added to a right circular cone of height \(7 - 4 = 3\) cm and base radius = 3.5 cm.

* The volume:  
  $$
  = \pi r^2 h_1 + \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h_2
  = \pi \times (3.5)^2 \times 4 + \frac{1}{3} \pi \times (3.5)^2 \times 3
  = \frac{245}{4} \pi \approx 192.4 \text{ cm}^3
  $$

(2) The formed solid is a right circular cone formed from the rotation of \(\triangle CAB\), its radius length of the base = 6 cm, its height = 8 cm, subtracted from a right circular cone formed from the rotation of the unshaded triangle and the radius length of its base = 3 cm and its height = 8 cm.

* The volume:  
  $$
  = \frac{1}{3} \pi (6)^2 \times 8 - \frac{1}{3} \pi (3)^2 \times 8
  = 72 \pi \approx 226.2 \text{ cm}^3
  $$

(3) The formed solid from the rotation around \(\overline{AB}\) is a right circular cylinder with base radius = AE and height CD, subtracted from it two right circular cones with the base radius of each of them = AE and their heights are CE, ED.

From the figure we notice that:

$$
CD = \sqrt{(15)^2 + (20)^2} = 25 \text{ cm}
$$

$$
AE = \frac{15 \times 20}{25} = 12 \text{ cm}
$$

* The volume:  
  $$
  = \pi (12)^2 \times 25 - \left(\frac{1}{3} \pi (12)^2 \times CE + \frac{1}{3} \pi (12)^2 \times ED \right)
  = \pi (12)^2 \times 25 - \frac{1}{3} \pi (12)^2 \times (CE + ED)
  = \pi (12)^2 \times 25 - \frac{1}{3} \pi \times (12)^2 \times 25
  = \pi (12)^2 \times 25 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2400 \pi
  \approx 7539.8 \text{ cm}^3
  $$

The equation of the second circle \( C_2 \) is  
$$ (x + 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25 $$

## 8
$$ C_1 : x^2 + y^2 - 2x + 6y + 1 = 0 $$  
∴ \( M_1 = (1, -3) \),  
$$ r_1 = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + (3)^2 - 1} = 3 \text{ length unit} $$  

$$ C_2 : x^2 + y^2 - 2x + 6y + \frac{15}{4} = 0 $$  
∴ \( M_2 = (1, -3) \),

The two circles are concentric.

## 9
$$ (x - 6)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 25 $$  
Substituting the coordinates of the points \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) we get:  
* \( A(9, 3) \)  
  $$ (9 - 6)^2 + (3 + 1)^2 = 25 = r^2 $$  
  ∴ The point A lies on the circle.  
* \( B(7, 5) \)  
  $$ (7 - 6)^2 + (5 + 1)^2 = 37 > r^2 $$  
  ∴ The point B is outside the circle.

∴ The straight line \( L_1 \) is outside the circle.

2. The length of the perpendicular  
$$ = \frac{|6 \times -3 - 8 \times 4 + 23|}{\sqrt{6^2 + (-8)^2}} = 2.7 < r $$

* \( C_2 : (x + 7)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 1 \)  
  ∴ \( M_2 = (-7, 3) \),  
  $$ r_2 = 1 \text{ length unit} $$

$$ r_1 + r_2 = 3 \text{ length unit} $$  
$$ M_1 M_2 = \sqrt{(5 + 7)^2 + (-2 - 3)^2} = 13 \text{ length unit} $$  
$$ M_1 M_2 > r_1 + r_2 $$  
∴ The two circles are disjoint (distant circles).

$$ C_2 : x^2 + y^2 + 14x + 10y - 26 = 0 $$  
∴ \( M_2 = (-7, -5) \),  
$$ r_2 = \sqrt{7^2 + 5^2 + 26} = 10 \text{ length unit} $$  

∴  
$$ r_1 + r_2 = 15 \text{ length unit} $$  
$$ M_1 M_2 = \sqrt{(5 + 7)^2 + (4 + 5)^2} = 15 \text{ length unit} $$  
$$ M_1 M_2 = r_1 + r_2 $$  
∴ The two circles are touching externally.

- Given:  
  $$ M_2 = (3,1), \quad r_2 = 4 \text{ length unit} $$

- If the two circles are touching externally:

  $$ \sqrt{(3+2)^2 + (1+11)^2} = 4 + \sqrt{K} $$  
  $$ 13 = 4 + \sqrt{K} \quad \Rightarrow \quad K = 81 $$

- If the two circles are touching internally:  
  $$ |r_2 - r_1| = M_1 M_2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad |4 - \sqrt{K}| = 13 $$  
  $$ 4 - \sqrt{K} = 13 \text{ refused or } 4 - \sqrt{K} = -13 $$  
  $$ \Rightarrow \sqrt{K} = 4 + 13 = 17 \quad \Rightarrow \quad K = 289 $$

## 15. The point of tangency:

$$ x^2 + y^2 - 6x - 4y + 12 = x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 4y - 4 $$

$$ \Rightarrow -6x - 2x = -12 - 4 $$  
$$ \Rightarrow -8x = -16 $$  
$$ \Rightarrow x = 2 $$

By substitution in the first circle equation with \( x = 2 \):

$$ (2)^2 + y^2 - 6 \times 2 - 4y + 12 = 0 $$  
$$ y^2 - 4y + 4 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 2 $$

- The two circles intersected at one point \((2, 2)\)  
- The two circles touch each other  
- The equation of the circle whose center is \((2, 2)\) and passes through the center of the second circle \((-1, 2)\):

$$ r = \sqrt{(2+1)^2 + (0)^2} = 3 $$

# Geometry and Measurement

## 22  
Given:  
$$ l = -5, \quad k = 3, \quad c = 25 $$  
$$ r^2 = 25 + 9 - 25 = 9 $$  
Therefore, the area of the regular hexagon  
$$ = \frac{n}{2} r^2 \sin\left(\frac{360^\circ}{n}\right) $$  
$$ = \frac{6}{2} \times 9 \sin 60^\circ = \left(\frac{27 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \text{ square units} $$

## 23  
Given:  
$$ r^2 = 16 $$  
Therefore, the area of the regular polygon  
$$ = \frac{n}{2} r^2 \sin\left(\frac{360^\circ}{n}\right) $$  
$$ = \frac{12}{2} \times 16 \times \sin 30^\circ = 48 \text{ square units} $$

## 24  
The centre of the circle is the point of intersection of the two diameters.

Equations:  
$$ 3x + y = -2 \quad (1) $$  
$$ 4x - y = 16 \quad (2) $$  

From (1) and (2):  
$$ x = 2, \quad y = -8 $$  

Therefore, the centre of the circle \( M = (2, -8) \)  

The equation of the circle is  
$$ (x - 2)^2 + (y + 8)^2 = 25 $$  
i.e.,  
$$ x^2 + y^2 - 4x + 16y + 43 = 0 $$  

Substituting \( x = 5 \) and \( y = -4 \):  
$$ \text{LHS} = (5)^2 + (-4)^2 - 4(5) + 16(-4) + 43 = 0 = \text{RHS} $$  

Therefore, \( (5, -4) \in \) the circle.

## 25  
Given:  
$$ \vec{r} = (1, 5) + k(1, 2) \quad \text{i.e.} \quad \frac{y - 5}{x - 1} = 2 $$  
$$ 2x - 2 = y - 5 $$  
$$ 2x - y = -3 \quad (1), \quad x + y = 0 \quad (2) $$  

From (1) and (2):  
The point of intersection of the two diameters is \( (-1, 1) \)  

Therefore, the centre of the circle \( M = (-1, 1) \)  

$$ x^2 + y^2 - 2x \cos \theta - 2y \sin \theta - 8 = 0 $$  
$$ l = -\cos \theta, \quad k = -\sin \theta, \quad c = -8 $$  

$$ r = \sqrt{\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta + 8} = \sqrt{1 + 8} = 3 \text{ length units} $$  

Therefore, the equation of the required circle is  
$$ (x + 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 9 $$

## 26  
The intersection points of the two circles:  

$$ x^2 + y^2 - 10x = x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 12 $$  
$$ \Rightarrow -10x - 2x = -12 $$  
$$ \Rightarrow -12x = -12 \quad \Rightarrow x = 1 $$  

By substitution in the first circle equation to find the value of \( y \) by \( x = 1 \):  
$$ (1)^2 + y^2 - 10(1) = 0 $$  
$$ y^2 = 9 \quad \Rightarrow y = \pm 3 $$  

Therefore, the intersection points are \( (1, 3) \) and \( (1, -3) \).

1. The centre of the circle is \( (0, 0) \):  
- Distance between first point and the centre  
$$ = \sqrt{(1 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{10} $$  
- Distance between second point and the centre  
$$ = \sqrt{(1 - 0)^2 + (-3 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{10} $$  
Therefore, the two points lie on a circle of centre \( (0, 0) \) and radius length \( \sqrt{10} \) length units.  
Equation of the circle is:  
$$ x^2 + y^2 = 10 $$  

2. The centre of the circle is \( (2, 0) \):  
- Distance between first point and the centre  
$$ = \sqrt{(1 - 2)^2 + (3 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{10} $$  
- Distance between second point and the centre  
$$ = \sqrt{(1 - 2)^2 + (-3 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{10} $$  
Therefore, the two points lie on a circle of centre \( (2, 0) \) and radius length \( \sqrt{10} \) length units.  
Equation of the circle is:  
$$ (x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 10 $$

## 27  
$$ MA = \sqrt{(-5)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{41} \text{ length units} $$  
$$ MB = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-5)^2} = \sqrt{41} \text{ length units} $$  
$$ MC = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{41} \text{ length units} $$  

Therefore,  
$$ MA = MB = MC $$  

Therefore, points \( A, B, \) and \( C \) lie on the same circle.  

The equation of the circle is  
$$ (x + 5)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 41 $$

- The centre of its circumcircle is  
  $$\left(\frac{-2 + 4 + 1}{3}, \frac{0 + 0 + 3\sqrt{3}}{3}\right) = \left(1, \sqrt{3}\right)$$

- Radius:  
  $$r = MA = \sqrt{\left(-3\right)^2 + \left(-3\sqrt{3}\right)^2} = 2\sqrt{3} \text{ length units}$$

- The equation of the circle is  
  $$(x - 1)^2 + \left(y - \sqrt{3}\right)^2 = 12$$

----

## 31

Given points: \((2, -1), (-2, 0), (0, -9)\)  
Verify the equation of the circle.

- Substituting points:  
  $$4 + 1 + 4l - 2k + c = 0$$  
  i.e.

  $$4 - 4l + c = 0 \quad (2)$$  
  $$81 - 18k + c = 0 \quad (3)$$

- From (1), (2) and (3):

- Therefore, the equation is  
  $$x^2 + y^2 + 2x + 9y = 0$$

- The centre of the circle \(M = (-1, -4.5)\)  
- Radius:  
  $$r = \sqrt{1 + (4.5)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{85}}{2} \text{ length unit}$$

  $$l = -3, \quad k = -5, \quad c = 9$$

- The equation of the circle is  
  $$x^2 + y^2 - 6x - 10y + 9 = 0$$

- Substituting by the coordinates of the point D:  
  - Left hand side = \((-1)^2 + (2)^2 - 6(-1) - 10(2) + 9\)  
  - \(= 1 + 4 + 6 - 20 + 9 = 0\)

### Instructions to solve 1:

1. Put $k - 2 = 2 - k$

   $$\therefore 2k = 4 \implies k = 2$$

   Then the equation becomes:

   $$-2x + 6y - 25 = 0$$

   *Equation of straight line*

   At $k \neq 2$, then the coefficient of $x^2$ is not equal to the coefficient of $y^2$.

   Therefore, the equation does not express a circle whatever the value of $k$.

2. The equation of the base of the cone is:

   $$x^2 + y^2 = 64$$

   Therefore, the radius length of the base of the cone is 8 length units.

----

* The volume of the cone is:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  & \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \\
  & = \frac{1}{3} \pi \times 64 \times 6 \\
  & = 128 \pi \text{ cubic units}
  \end{aligned}
  $$

3. The centre of the circle is $(7, 5)$, radius $r = 4$ length units.

* The distance between the centre and the y-axis is 7 length units.
* The least distance between the y-axis and any point on the circle is:

  $$7 - 4 = 3 \text{ length units}$$

4. The centre of the circle that touches the two coordinate axes must lie on the straight line $y = x$ or $y = -x$.

* The circle $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ intersects the two lines $y = x$ and $y = -x$ at four points as in the opposite figure.

* Therefore, the number of circles is 4.

----

5. From the opposite figure:

* $\triangle AOC$ is a right-angled triangle at $O$ and $\overline{OB} \perp \overline{AC}$

* $OB^2 = 8 \times 2 = 16$

* $OB = 4$ length units.

* The centre of the circle is $(0, 0)$

* The equation of the circle is:

  $$x^2 + y^2 = 16$$

6. Since $OB \times OA = OC \times OD$,

* $4 \times OA = 8 \times 6$

* $OA = 12$

* $A = (12, 0)$

* Draw $\overline{ME} \perp \overline{AB}$ and $\overline{MN} \perp \overline{DC}$

* $E$ is midpoint of $\overline{AB}$

* $E = (4, 0)$, $N$ is midpoint of $\overline{DC}$

* $N = (0, 1)$, $M = (4, 1)$

* Radius $r = MA = \sqrt{(12 - 4)^2 + (0 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{65}$

* The equation of the circle is:

  $$(x - 4)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 65$$

### (7)  
The centre of the given circle \( M = (5, -2) \)

- \( MA \perp AO \)
- \( MB \perp OB \)

There is a circle passing through the vertices of the figure AMBO and its diameter \(\overline{OM}\) and its centre is the midpoint of \(\overline{MO}\).

\[
\therefore \text{The centre is } \left(\frac{5+0}{2}, \frac{-2+0}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{5}{2}, -1\right)
\]

and it is the same circle that passes through the vertices of the \(\triangle AOB\).

----

### (8) According to the first circle:

\[
M_1 = (5, 5)
\]
\[
r_1 = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

According to the second circle:

\[
M_2 = (-3, -1), \quad r_2 = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

\[
\therefore \text{the length of } M_1M_2 = \sqrt{(5+3)^2 + (5+1)^2} = 10 \text{ length unit}
\]

\[
\therefore (M_1M_2)^2 = (AM_1)^2 + (AM_2)^2
\]

\[
\therefore \text{The figure } AM_1BM_2 \text{ is a square}
\]

\[
\therefore AB = 10 \text{ length unit}
\]

----

### 2  
The circle \(N\) touches the two coordinate axes in the 3rd quadrant.

\[
\therefore N \text{ is } (-l, -l) \text{ satisfies the equation of the straight line } y = 2x + 1
\]

\[
\therefore -l = -2(l + 1) \implies l = 1
\]

\[
\therefore \text{The centre of the circle } N \text{ is } (-1, -1)
\]

\[
\therefore \text{The equation of the circle } N \text{ is } (x+1)^2 + (y+1)^2 = 1
\]

\[
\text{then } x^2 + y^2 + 2x + 2y + 1 = 0
\]

The circle \(M\) touches the two coordinate axes in the 2nd quadrant.

\[
\therefore M \text{ is } (-k, k) \text{ verifies the equation of the straight line } y = 2x + 1
\]

\[
\therefore k = -2k + 1 \implies k = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Draw \(\overline{MD} \perp \overline{OY}\)

Let the radius length of the circle \(M\) be \(r\) length unit.

In \(\triangle MND\):

\[
(8 + r)^2 = 8^2 + (8 - r)^2
\]

\[
\therefore 64 + r^2 + 16r = 64 + 64 + r^2 - 16r
\]

\[
\therefore 32r = 64 \implies r = 2
\]

\[
\therefore \text{The centre of the circle } M \text{ is } (8, 2)
\]

\[
\therefore \text{The equation of the circle } M \text{ is } (x - 8)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 4
\]

i.e.

\[
x^2 + y^2 - 16x - 4y + 64 = 0

## Life Applications

1.  
\[
r = \sqrt{l^2 + k^2 - c} = \sqrt{(3)^2 + (-4)^2 - 11} = \sqrt{14} \text{ length unit}
\]

\[
\therefore \text{The area of the circle} = \pi r^2 = 14 \pi
\]

\[
\therefore \text{The square unit in the plane represents } (5)^2 = 25 \text{ cm}^2
\]

\[
\therefore \text{The area of the square} = 14 \times \frac{22}{7} \times 25 = 1100 \text{ cm}^2
\]

2.  
\[
\therefore \text{The equation of the circle is } (x - 7)^2 + (y + 9)^2 = (30)^2
\]

\[
BA = \sqrt{(25 - 7)^2 + (-30 + 9)^2} \approx 27.66
\]

\[
\therefore BA < r
\]

\[
\therefore \text{The radar can observe the ship whose position is at } (B)

#### 1

Let **AB** in direction of **OX**

$$
\begin{aligned}
X &= 8 \cos 0^\circ + 6 \sqrt{3} \cos 30^\circ + 5 \cos 60^\circ + 4 \sqrt{3} \cos 90^\circ = 19.5 \\
Y &= 8 \sin 0^\circ + 6 \sqrt{3} \sin 30^\circ + 5 \sin 60^\circ + 4 \sqrt{3} \sin 90^\circ = 9.5 \sqrt{3} \\
\therefore \mathbf{R} &= 19.5 \mathbf{i} + 9.5 \sqrt{3} \mathbf{j} \\
\therefore |\mathbf{R}| &= \sqrt{651} \text{ newtons} \\
\tan \theta &= \frac{19 \sqrt{3}}{39} \Rightarrow \theta = 40^\circ 9'
\end{aligned}
$$

* Magnitude of the resultant is $\sqrt{651}$ newtons and makes an angle of measure $40^\circ 9'$ with **AB**.

#### 2

From the figure:

* $\triangle ABM$ is the triangle of forces
* $AB = \sqrt{(20)^2 - (10)^2} = 10 \sqrt{3}$
* $\frac{30}{AB} = \frac{r}{BM} = \frac{T}{AM}$
* $\frac{30}{10 \sqrt{3}} = \frac{10}{20} = \frac{T}{r}$
* $\therefore r = 10 \sqrt{3}$ gm.wt., $T = 20 \sqrt{3}$ gm.wt.

#### 3

$$
\begin{aligned}
v &= \frac{1}{3} l^2 h \\
1296 &= \frac{1}{3} (18)^2 (AM) \\
\therefore AM &= 12 \text{ cm} \\
\text{Slant height} &= AF = \sqrt{(AM)^2 + (MF)^2} = \sqrt{12^2 + 9^2} = 15 \text{ cm} \\
\text{Lateral surface area} &= \frac{1}{2} (18 \times 4) \times 15 = 540 \text{ cm}^2
\end{aligned}

   $$
   \tan \theta = \frac{10 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \sqrt{3} \implies \theta = 60^\circ

   The magnitude of \(\vec{R}\) is 20 kg.wt. and makes an angle of measure \(60^\circ\) with AB.

   $$
   \tan \theta = \frac{6 \sin 120^\circ}{9 + 6 \cos 120^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}/2}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies \theta = 40^\circ 53' 36''

### Second: Essay questions

1. From the figure \(\triangle ABC\):

   - \( (AB)^2 = (BC)^2 + (AC)^2 \)
   - \(\therefore m(\angle ACB) = 90^\circ\)
   - \(CD = \frac{1}{2} AB = 50 \text{ cm}\)
   - \(CD = DB = t\), \(m(\angle B) = \theta_1\)
   - \(CD = AD\), \(m(\angle A) = \theta_2\)

   Using the sine rule:

   $$
   \frac{T_1}{\sin(90^\circ + \theta_1)} = \frac{T_2}{\sin(90^\circ + \theta_2)} = \frac{150}{\sin 90^\circ}
   $$

   Therefore,

   $$
   \frac{T_1}{\cos \theta_1} = \frac{T_2}{\cos \theta_2} = 150
   $$

   And,

   $$
   \frac{T_1}{6/10} = \frac{T_2}{8/10} = 150
   $$

   So,

   $$
   T_1 = 90 \text{ gm.wt.}, \quad T_2 = 120 \text{ gm.wt.}
   $$

2. The volume of the pyramid is 1296.

   - \(\frac{1}{3} \times (18)^2 \times h = 1296\)
   - \(h = 12 \text{ cm}\)

   Slant height:

   $$
   = \sqrt{h^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2} \text{side}\right)^2} = \sqrt{12^2 + \left(\frac{18}{2}\right)^2} = 15 \text{ cm}
   $$

   Lateral surface area:

   $$
   = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{perimeter of the base} \times \text{slant height} = \frac{1}{2} \times (4 \times 18) \times 15 = 540 \text{ cm}^2
   $$

3. Using trigonometry:

   $$
   \tan 30^\circ = \frac{F \sin 120^\circ}{16 + F \cos 120^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
   $$

   Solving,

   $$
   16 - \frac{1}{2} F = \frac{3}{2} F \implies 2F = 16 \implies F = 8 \text{ kg.wt.}
   $$

   Resultant force:

   $$
   R = \sqrt{(16)^2 + (8)^2 + 2 \times 16 \times 8 \cos 120^\circ} = 8 \sqrt{3} \text{ kg.wt.}

   Applying Lami's rule:

   $$
   \frac{r_1}{\sin 150^\circ} = \frac{r_2}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{400}{\sin 120^\circ}
   $$

   Therefore,

   $$
   r_1 = \frac{400 \times \sin 150^\circ}{\sin 120^\circ} = \frac{400 \sqrt{3}}{3} \text{ kg.wt.}
   $$

   $$
   r_2 = \frac{400 \times \sin 90^\circ}{\sin 120^\circ} = \frac{800 \sqrt{3}}{3} \text{ kg.wt.}
   $$

1. Volume of the pyramid:

   $$
   = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times \text{height}
   $$

   $$
   = 8 \sqrt{3} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times 4
   $$

   Base area:

   $$
   = 6 \sqrt{3} \text{ cm}^2
   $$

   $$
   \therefore \frac{6}{4} \times x^2 \times \cot \frac{\pi}{6} = 6 \sqrt{3}
   $$

## Additional Calculations and Notes

- From the figure \(\triangle ABC\), forces:

  $$
  AB = \sqrt{20^2 - 10^2} = 10 \sqrt{3}
  $$

- Calculations for tension \(T\):

  $$
  \frac{30}{10 \sqrt{3}} = \frac{R}{10} = \frac{T}{20}
  $$

  $$
  \therefore T = \frac{30 \times 20}{10 \sqrt{3}} = 20 \sqrt{3} \text{ gm.wt.}
  $$

  $$
  R = \frac{30 \times 10}{10 \sqrt{3}} = 10 \sqrt{3} \text{ gm.wt.}
  $$

- Considering \(\overrightarrow{CB}, \overrightarrow{CD}\) axes \(OX, OY\):

  $$
  X = 2 \cos 0^\circ + 7 \sqrt{5} \cos 9^\circ + 4 \sqrt{2} \cos 45^\circ + 4 \cos 90^\circ
  $$

  $$
  = 2 + 7 \sqrt{5} \times \frac{10}{5 \sqrt{5}} + 4 \sqrt{2} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 0 = 20 \text{ newton}
  $$

  $$
  Y = 2 \sin 0^\circ + 7 \sqrt{5} \sin 9^\circ + 4 \sqrt{2} \sin 45^\circ + 4 \sin 90^\circ
  $$

  $$
  = 0 + 7 \sqrt{5} \times \frac{5}{5 \sqrt{5}} + 4 \sqrt{2} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 4 = 15 \text{ newton}
  $$

  $$
  R = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2} = \sqrt{20^2 + 15^2} = 25 \text{ newton}
  $$

  $$
  \therefore \frac{Y}{X} = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}
  $$

  $$
  \therefore \theta = 36^\circ 52' 12'' \text{ with first force}
  $$

- For \(\triangle AHB\) right-angled at \(B\):

  $$
  AH = \sqrt{(5)^2 + (12)^2} = 13 \text{ cm}
  $$

  $$
  \sin (\angle BAH) = \frac{5}{13}
  $$

  $$
  \cos (\angle BAH) = \frac{12}{13}
  $$

- \(AC\) is a diagonal of the square \(ABCD\):

  $$
  \alpha = 45^\circ
  $$

  $$
  X = 2 \cos 0^\circ + 13 \cos (\angle BAH) + 9 \cos 90^\circ + 4 \sqrt{2} \cos 225^\circ
  $$

  $$
  = 2 \times 1 + 13 \times \frac{12}{13} + 9 \times 0 + 4 \sqrt{2} \times \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} = 10
  $$

  $$
  Y = 2 \sin 0^\circ + 13 \sin (\angle BAH) + 9 \sin 90^\circ + 4 \sqrt{2} \sin 225^\circ
  $$

  $$
  = 0 + 13 \times \frac{5}{13} + 9 \times 1 + 4 \sqrt{2} \times \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} = 10
  $$

  $$
  \vec{R} = 10 \hat{i} + 10 \hat{j}
  $$

  $$
  R = \sqrt{(10)^2 + (10)^2} = 10 \sqrt{2} \text{ gm.wt.}
  $$

  $$
  \tan \theta = \frac{10}{10} = 1
  $$

  $$
  \therefore X > 0, Y > 0 \implies \theta = 45^\circ
  $$

  $$
  \therefore R \text{ acts due to } AC
  $$

## Second Essay questions

### 1

- AC = AD = 4 metres
- \( m(\angle ACD) = 45^\circ \)
- CD = \(4\sqrt{2}\) metres

From \(\triangle MCN\):

- MN = 1 metre, \( m(\angle NCM) = 45^\circ \)
- \( m(\angle NMC) = 90^\circ \)
- NC = \(\sqrt{2}\) metres
- DN = \(4\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2} = 3\sqrt{2}\) metres

From \(\triangle AMN\): AN = \(\sqrt{10}\) metres (Pythagoras)

Since \(\triangle AND\) is the triangle of forces:

$$
\frac{r}{\sqrt{10}} = \frac{T}{3\sqrt{2}} = \frac{8}{4}
$$

Therefore,

$$
r = 2\sqrt{10} \text{ kg.wt.}, \quad T = 6\sqrt{2} \text{ kg.wt.}
$$

### 2

The length of the drawer of the cone = 18 cm.

- The circumference of the circle of the cone base = the length of AB

$$
= r \times \theta^\circ = 18 \times \frac{60^\circ \times \pi}{180^\circ} = 6\pi
$$

$$
2\pi r = 6\pi \implies r = 3 \text{ cm}
$$

- Height \(h\):

$$
h = \sqrt{r^2 - r^2} = \sqrt{(18)^2 - 3^2} = 3\sqrt{35} \text{ cm}
$$

- Volume of the cone:

$$
= \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times (3)^2 \times 3\sqrt{35} = 167.3 \text{ cm}^3
$$

# Additional Calculations and Solutions

### 1.

$$
X = F \cos 0^\circ + 80 \cos 60^\circ + K \cos 90^\circ + 50 \cos 180^\circ + 80 \sqrt{3} \cos 270^\circ
$$

$$
= F \times 1 + 80 \times \frac{1}{2} + K \times 0 + 50 \times (-1) + 80 \sqrt{3} \times 0
= F - 10
$$

$$
Y = F \sin 0^\circ + 80 \sin 60^\circ + K \sin 90^\circ + 50 \sin 180^\circ + 80 \sqrt{3} \sin 270^\circ
$$

$$
= F \times 0 + 80 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + K \times 1 + 50 \times 0 + 80 \sqrt{3} \times (-1)
= 40 \sqrt{3} + K - 80 \sqrt{3} = K - 40 \sqrt{3}
$$

Resultant vector:

$$
\vec{R} = (F - 10) \hat{i} + (K - 40 \sqrt{3}) \hat{j}
$$

Given:

$$
R = 40 \text{ newton due to } 60^\circ \text{ North of East}
$$

$$
\vec{R} = 40 \cos 60^\circ \hat{i} + 40 \sin 60^\circ \hat{j} = 20 \hat{i} + 20 \sqrt{3} \hat{j}
$$

From the above:

$$
F - 10 = 20 \implies F = 30 \text{ newton}
$$

$$
K - 40 \sqrt{3} = 20 \sqrt{3} \implies K = 60 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}
$$

### 2.

\(\triangle MAB\) is the triangle of forces:

$$
\frac{50}{MA} = \frac{25}{BM} = \frac{W}{AB}
$$

$$
\frac{MA}{MB} = \frac{50}{25} = 2
$$

$$
MA = 2 \times 12 = 24
$$

Length of the string:

$$
CA = 24 - 12 = 12 \text{ cm}
$$

From \(\triangle MAB\) which is right-angled at B:

$$
AB = 12 \sqrt{3}
$$

$$
W = 25 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}
$$

----

### 3.

$$
X = 10 \cos 0^\circ + 20 \cos 120^\circ + 30 \cos 240^\circ = 10 + 20 \times \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 30 \times \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -15
$$

$$
Y = 10 \sin 0^\circ + 20 \sin 120^\circ + 30 \sin 240^\circ = 0 + 20 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 30 \times \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = -5 \sqrt{3}
$$

Resultant vector:

$$
\vec{R} = -15 \hat{i} - 5 \sqrt{3} \hat{j}
$$

Magnitude:

$$
R = \sqrt{(-15)^2 + (-5 \sqrt{3})^2} = 10 \sqrt{3} \text{ newton}
$$

Angle:

$$
\tan \theta = \frac{-5 \sqrt{3}}{-15} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \implies \theta = 210^\circ
$$

Line of action of the resultant is in direction \(30^\circ\) south of west.

----

### 4.

$$
X = 12 \cos 0^\circ + 9 \cos 90^\circ + 5 \sqrt{2} \cos 135^\circ + 7 \sqrt{2} \cos 225^\circ + 7 \cos 270^\circ
$$

$$
= 12 + 0 - 5 - 7 + 0 = 0
$$

$$
Y = 12 \sin 0^\circ + 9 \sin 90^\circ + 5 \sqrt{2} \sin 135^\circ + 7 \sqrt{2} \sin 225^\circ + 7 \sin 270^\circ
$$

$$
= 0 + 9 + 5 - 7 - 7 = 0
$$

Therefore,

$$
\vec{R} = 0
$$

The system is in equilibrium.

### 5.

- The set of forces are in equilibrium.
- \(r\) passes through the point E.
- \(DE \parallel AC\)
- E is the midpoint of BC.
- \(AE \perp BC\)
- \(EC = 40 \sqrt{3}\), \(AC = 80 \text{ cm}\)
- \(AE = 40 \text{ cm}\) (Pythagoras theorem)

\(\triangle AEC\) is the triangle of forces:

$$
\frac{r}{40} = \frac{T}{40 \sqrt{3}} = \frac{24}{80} \implies r = 40 \times \frac{24}{80} = 12 \text{ kg.wt.}

# Model 4

From the figure:  
CE = \(2 \sqrt{10}\) cm.  
* The forces are in equilibrium.  
* \(X = 0\), \(y = 0\)  
* \(F = 5 \cos 60^\circ + 6 \sqrt{10} \cos \theta + k \cos 90^\circ = 0\)  
* \(F = 5 \times \frac{1}{2} + 6 \sqrt{10} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} + 0 = 0\)  
* \(F = 2 + 6 = 0\)  
* \(F = 2\) newton.

----

$$

$$
\tan \theta = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3}
$$

* The magnitude resultant is \(240^\circ\) to \(x\)-axis.  
* It makes an angle of measure \(240^\circ\) with \(OX\).

1. Volume of the cone = \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = \frac{1}{3} \pi (6)^2 \times 8 = 96 \pi\) cubic units  
2. Length of drawer = \(\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = 10\) units  
3. Total surface area = \(\pi r (r + l)\)  
\[
= \pi \times 6 (6 + 10) = 96 \pi \text{ square units}
\]

----

## Circle Centers and Equidistant Point

* Center of 1st circle \(C_1 (1, -3)\)  
* The equation of circle \(C_1\) is \( (x - 1)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 16 \)  
* Center of 2nd circle \(C_2 (-2, 6)\) and \(x^2 + y^2 + 6y + 15 = 0\)  
* They have same centre.  
* They are concentric circles.  
* \(T_1 = \sqrt{(0 + 1)^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 9} = \sqrt{10} = 3\) length unit.  
* \(T_2 = \sqrt{(1 + 3)^2 + 6^2} = 2.5\) length unit.

----

## Equations and Solutions

Let the centre is \((x, y)\).  
* The centre is equidistant from \((1, 3)\) & \((-2, -4)\)  
\[
\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = \sqrt{(x + 2)^2 + (y + 4)^2}
\]

\[
(x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = (x + 2)^2 + (y + 4)^2
\]

\[
x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 - 6y + 9 = x^2 + 4x + 4 + y^2 + 8y + 16
\]

\[
-2x + 1 - 6y + 9 = 4x + 4 + 8y + 16
\]

\[
-2x - 6y + 10 = 4x + 8y + 20
\]

\[
-2x - 6y + 10 - 4x - 8y - 20 = 0
\]

\[
-6x - 14y - 10 = 0
\]

\[
3x + 7y = -5
\]

* \(y = 0\)  
* The centre is \((5, 0)\). The equation of the circle is \((x - 5)^2 + y^2 = 25\).

# Model 5

## Surface Area and Volume

* The total surface area = \(\pi r (l + r)\)  
\[
= \pi \times 10 (10 + r)
\]

\[

\]

* \(h = \sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = 8\) cm.  
* Volume of the cone = \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = \frac{1}{3} \pi (r^2) \times 96 \pi\) cm\(^3\).

----

## Triangle Forces

From the figure, \(\triangle ABC\) represents a triangle.  
* \(AB = 10^2\)  
* \(30 = \frac{10^2}{2}\)  
* \(T = \frac{10^3}{2}\)  
* \(R = 20 \sqrt{3} = 10 \sqrt{3}\) gm. wt.

----

## Triangle Properties

\[
(AB)^2 = (BC)^2 + (AC)^2
\]

\[
m(\angle ACB) = 90^\circ
\]

\[
CD = \frac{1}{2} AB = 50 \text{ cm}
\]

\[
CD = DB
\]

\[
CD = AD
\]

----

## Force Calculations

\[
\therefore m(\angle B) = \theta_1
\]

\[
\therefore m(\angle A) = \theta_2
\]

\[
T_1 = \frac{T \sin 90^\circ + \theta_1}{\sin \theta_2}
\]

\[
T_1 = \frac{150}{\sin \theta_2}
\]

\[
T_2 = \frac{T \sin 90^\circ + \theta_2}{\cos \theta_1}
\]

\[
T_2 = \frac{150}{\cos \theta_1}
\]

\[
T_1 = 90 \text{ gm. wt.}, \quad T_2 = 120 \text{ gm. wt.}
\]

----

## Consider \(CT\) and \(CD\)

\[
X = 2 \cos 0^\circ + \sqrt{7} \cos 60^\circ
\]

\[
X = 0 + 4 \sqrt{7} \times \frac{1}{2} \cos 90^\circ
\]

\[
X = 2 + \sqrt{7} \times \frac{5}{3}
\]

\[
Y = 2 \sin 0^\circ + \sqrt{7} \sin 45^\circ + 4 \sqrt{7} \sin 90^\circ
\]

\[
Y = 0 + \sqrt{7} \times \frac{5}{3} + 4 \sqrt{7} \times \frac{1}{2} + 4
\]

\[
Y = 0 + \sqrt{7} \times \frac{5}{3} + 4 \sqrt{7} \times \frac{1}{2} + 4

= \frac{1}{2} \times (4 \times 20) \times 20 = 800 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

2. **Volume**

\[
= \frac{1}{3} \times \text{area of the base} \times h
= \frac{1}{3} \times (20)^2 \times \frac{10\sqrt{3}}{3} = 800\sqrt{3} \, \text{cm}^3
\]

----

### Problem 7

- Volume of the cone

\[
= \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times r^2 \times h = \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 \times 18 = 67.5 \pi \approx 167.3 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

----

### Problem 13

\[
X = 10 \cos 0^\circ + 20 \times \frac{1}{2} + 30 \times \cos 120^\circ

= 12 + 0 - 7 \sqrt{2} \times \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + 0 = 12 + 0 + 7 + 0 = 19
\]

\[
Y = 12 \sin 0^\circ + 9 \sin 90^\circ + 7 \sqrt{2} \sin 225^\circ + 7 \sin 270^\circ
= 0 + 9 - 7 \sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 7 = 0 + 9 - 7 - 7 = -5
\]

----

### Problem 18

\[
r = 4 \, \text{cm}
\]
