# Frontend Section

This is the **frontend section** of the project.

## Overview

Inside the `src/` directory, you will find:
- **assets/** – images, icons, and other static resources  
- **components/** – reusable UI components used throughout the application  
- **services/** – API and utility service files for data handling  

The frontend is built using:  
- **Vite** – for fast development and optimized builds  
- **React.js** – for building dynamic user interfaces  
- **CSS** – for styling and layout  

## Getting Started

To run the frontend locally:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
